than ten new editions of her novels within a decade and three memoirs by different hands within as many years have made the facts of her life familiar to most readers it was a short life and an uneventful one as viewed from the standpoint of our modern times when steam and electricity have linked together the ends of the earth and the very air seems teeming with news agitations discussions we have barely time to recover our breath between post and post and the morning paper with its statements of disaster and its hints of still greater evils to be is scarcely outlived when lo in comes the evening issue contradicting the news of the morning to be sure but full of omens and auguries of its own to strew our pillows with the seed of wakefulness to us publications come hot and hot from the press telegraphic wires like the intricate and incalculable zigzags of the lightning ramify above our heads and who can tell at what moment their darts may strike in miss austens day the tranquil drowsy decorous english day of a century since all was different news travelled then from hand to hand carried in creaking postwagons or in cases of extreme urgency by men on horseback when a gentleman journeying in his own chaise took three days in going from exeter to london a distance now covered in three hours of railroad there was little chance of frequent surprises love sorrow and death were in the world then as now and worked their will upon the sons of men but people did not expect happenings every day or even every year no doubt they lived the longer for this exemption from excitement and kept their nerves in a state of wholesome repair but it goes without saying that the events of which they knew so little did not stir them deeply miss austens life coincided with two of the momentous epochs of historythe american struggle for independence and the french revolution but there is scarcely an allusion to either in her letters she was interested in the fleet and its victories because two of her brothers were in the navy and had promotion and prizemoney to look forward to in this connection she mentions trafalgar and the egyptian expedition and generously remarks that she would read southeys life of nelson if there was anything in it about her brother frank she honors sir john moore by remarking after his death that his mother would perhaps have preferred to have him less distinguished and still alive further than that the making of the gooseberry jam and a good recipe for orange wine interests her more than all the marchings and countermarchings the manoeuvres and diplomacies going on the world over in the midst of the universal vortex of fear and hope triumph and defeat while the fate of britain and british liberty hung trembling in the balance she sits writing her letters trimming her caps and discussing small beer with her sister in a lively and unruffled fashion wonderful to contemplate the society of rural england in those days as mr goldwin smith happily puts it enjoyed a calm of its own in the midst of the european tempest like the windless centre of a circular storm the point of view of a woman with such an environment must naturally be circumscribed and narrow and in this miss austens charm consists seeing little she painted what she saw with absolute fidelity and a dexterity and perfection unequalled on her was bestowed though in a humble form the gift which had been bestowed on homer shakespeare cervantes scott and a few othersthe gift of creative power endowed with the keenest and most delicate insight and a vivid sense of humor she depicted with exactitude what she observed and what she understood giving to each fact and emotion its precise shade and value the things she did not see she did not attempt affectation was impossible to hermost of all affectation of knowledge or feeling not justly her own she held the mirror up to her time with an exquisite sincerity and fidelity and the closeness of her study brought her intimately near to those hidden springs which underlie all human nature this is the reason why for all their skimp skirts legofmutton sleeves and bygone impossible bonnets her characters do not seem to us oldfashioned minds and hearts are made pretty much after the same pattern from century to century and given a modern dress and speech emma or elizabeth or dear anne eliot could enter a drawingroom today and excite no surprise except by so closely resembling the people whom they would find there miss austens novels are dateless things mr augustine birrell tells us nobody in his senses would speak of them as old novels john inglesant is an old novel so is ginxs baby but emma is quite new and like a wise woman affords few clues to her age we allude with a special touch of affection to anne eliot persuasion which was written during the last two years of miss austens life when the refining touch of eternity was already upon her has always seemed to us the most perfect of her novels and anne with her exquisite breeding and unselfish straightforwardness just touched with the tender reserve of memory and regret one of her best portraitures but this is a matter of individual taste doubtless elizabeth bennet is better fun as the modern girl would say miss austen herself preferred her she had a droll and pretty way of talking about her characters which showed how real they were to her own mind and made them equally real to other people in she had the good luck to light upon a portrait of jane bennet at an exhibition i was very well pleased pray tell fanny with a small portrait of mrs bingley excessively like her i went in hopes of seeing one of her sister but there was no mrs darcy perhaps i may find her in the great exhibition which we shall go to if we have time mrs bingleys is exactly like herselfsize shaped face features and sweetness there never was a greater likeness she is dressed in a white gown with green ornaments which convinces me of what i had always supposed that green was a favorite color with her i dare say mrs d will be in yellow and later we have been both to the exhibition and sir j reynolds and i am disappointed for there was nothing like mrs d at either i can only imagine that mr d prizes any picture of her too much to like it should be exposed to the public eye i can imagine he would have that sort of feelingthat mixture of love pride and delicacy the letters included in this series comprise about three quarters of the collection in two volumes published in by her greatnephew lord brabourne the lightness almost friskiness of their tone cannot fail to strike the reader modern letters written by women are filled more or less with hints and queries questionings as to the why and the wherefore occur allusions to the various fads of the day literary or artisticibsen tolstoi browning esoteric buddhism wagners music the mind cure social science causes and reforms but cowper and crabbe were the poetical sensations in miss austens time scott and byron its phenomenal novelties it took months to get most books printed and years to persuade anybody to read them furthermore the letters in all probability are carefully chosen to reveal only the more superficial side of their writer there are wide gaps of omission covering important events such as mr austens death the long illness through which jane nursed her brother henry and the anxieties and worries which his failure in business caused to the whole family what is vouchsafed us is a glimpse of the girlish and untroubled moments of miss austens life and the glimpse is a sweet and friendly one we are glad to have it in spite of our suspicion that another and even more interesting part of her personality is withheld from us a good daughter a delightful sister the most perfect of aunts what better record could there be of a single woman her literary work never stood in the way of her home duties any more than her quiet limpid unimpassioned style stood between her thought and her readers her fame may justly be said to be almost entirely posthumous she was read and praised to a moderate degree during her lifetime but all her novels together brought her no more than seven hundred pounds and her reputation as it were was in its closesheathed bud when at the early age of fortyone she died it would have excited in her an amused incredulity no doubt had any one predicted that two generations after her death the real recognition of her powers was to come time which like desert sands has effaced the footprints of so many promising authors has with her served as the desert wind to blow aside those dusts of the commonplace which for a while concealed her true proportions she is loved more than she ever hoped to be and far more widely known mrs ritchie tells somewhere an anecdote of a party of seven assembled at a dinnertable where the question arose of the locality of one of miss austens placesmaple grove the residence of mr suckling if we are not mistakenand six of the persons present at once recognized the allusion and had a formed opinion on the subject the seventh was a frenchman who did not read english scott macaulay sir james mackintosh miss martineau mrs ritchie miss mitford and a host of others have vied in their generous tributes of admiration but most striking of all to our thinking is that paid to miss austen by lord tennyson when in some visit to lyme not many years since those with him pointed out this and the other feature of the place only to be interrupted withnever mind all that show me the exact spot where louisa musgrove fell could nonhistorical verisimilitude go farther or mean more s c w newport june illustration letters of jane austen i steventon thursday january i have just received yours and marys letter and i thank you both though their contents might have been more agreeable i do not at all expect to see you on tuesday since matters have fallen out so unpleasantly and if you are not able to return till after that day it will hardly be possible for us to send for you before saturday though for my own part i care so little about the ball that it would be no sacrifice to me to give it up for the sake of seeing you two days earlier we are extremely sorry for poor elizas illness i trust however that she has continued to recover since you wrote and that you will none of you be the worse for your attendance on her what a goodfornothing fellow charles is to bespeak the stockings i hope he will be too hot all the rest of his life for it i sent you a letter yesterday to ibthorp which i suppose you will not receive at kintbury it was not very long or very witty and therefore if you never receive it it does not much signify i wrote principally to tell you that the coopers were arrived and in good health the little boy is very like dr cooper and the little girl is to resemble jane they say our party to ashe tomorrow night will consist of edward cooper james for a ball is nothing without him buller who is now staying with us and i i look forward with great impatience to it as i rather expect to receive an offer from my friend in the course of the evening i shall refuse him however unless he promises to give away his white coat i am very much flattered by your commendation of my last letter for i write only for fame and without any view to pecuniary emolument edward is gone to spend the day with his friend john lyford and does not return till tomorrow anna is now here she came up in her chaise to spend the day with her young cousins but she does not much take to them or to anything about them except carolines spinningwheel i am very glad to find from mary that mr and mrs fowle are pleased with you i hope you will continue to give satisfaction how impertinent you are to write to me about tom as if i had not opportunities of hearing from him myself the last letter that i received from him was dated on friday th and he told me that if the wind should be favorable on sunday which it proved to be they were to sail from falmouth on that day by this time therefore they are at barbadoes i suppose the rivers are still at manydown and are to be at ashe tomorrow i intended to call on the miss biggs yesterday had the weather been tolerable caroline anna and i have just been devouring some cold souse and it would be difficult to say which enjoyed it most tell mary that i make over mr heartley and all his estate to her for her sole use and benefit in future and not only him but all my other admirers into the bargain wherever she can find them even the kiss which c powlett wanted to give me as i mean to confine myself in future to mr tom lefroy for whom i dont care sixpence assure her also as a last and indubitable proof of warrens indifference to me that he actually drew that gentlemans picture for me and delivered it to me without a sigh fridayat length the day is come on which i am to flirt my last with tom lefroy and when you receive this it will be over my tears flow as i write at the melancholy idea wm chute called here yesterday i wonder what he means by being so civil there is a report that tom is going to be married to a lichfield lass john lyford and his sister bring edward home today dine with us and we shall all go together to ashe i understand that we are to draw for partners i shall be extremely impatient to hear from you again that i may know how eliza is and when you are to return with best love etc i am affectionately yours j austen miss austen the rev mr fowles kintbury newbury ii cork street tuesday morn august my dear cassandrahere i am once more in this scene of dissipation and vice and i begin already to find my morals corrupted we reached staines yesterday i do not know when without suffering so much from the heat as i had hoped to do we set off again this morning at seven oclock and had a very pleasant drive as the morning was cloudy and perfectly cool i came all the way in the chaise from hertford bridge edward and frank are both gone out to seek their fortunes the latter is to return soon and help us seek ours the former we shall never see again we are to be at astleys tonight which i am glad of edward has heard from henry this morning he has not been at the races at all unless his driving miss pearson over to rowling one day can be so called we shall find him there on thursday i hope you are all alive after our melancholy parting yesterday and that you pursued your intended avocation with success god bless you i must leave off for we are going out yours very affectionately j austen everybodys love footnotes miss austens second brother francis afterward sir francis austen senior admiral of the fleet and k c b iii rowling monday september my dear cassandrai shall be extremely anxious to hear the event of your ball and shall hope to receive so long and minute an account of every particular that i shall be tired of reading it let me know how many besides their fourteen selves and mr and mrs wright michael will contrive to place about their coach and how many of the gentlemen musicians and waiters he will have persuaded to come in their shootingjackets i hope john lovetts accident will not prevent his attending the ball as you will otherwise be obliged to dance with mr tincton the whole evening let me know how j harwood deports himself without the miss biggs and which of the marys will carry the day with my brother james we were at a ball on saturday i assure you we dined at goodnestone and in the evening danced two countrydances and the boulangeries i opened the ball with edward bridges the other couples were lewis cage and harriet frank and louisa fanny and george elizabeth played one countrydance lady bridges the other which she made henry dance with her and miss finch played the boulangeries in reading over the last three or four lines i am aware of my having expressed myself in so doubtful a manner that if i did not tell you to the contrary you might imagine it was lady bridges who made henry dance with her at the same time that she was playing which if not impossible must appear a very improbable event to you but it was elizabeth who danced we supped there and walked home at night under the shade of two umbrellas today the goodnestone party begins to disperse and spread itself abroad mr and mrs cage and george repair to hythe lady waltham miss bridges and miss mary finch to dover for the health of the two former i have never seen marianne at all on thursday mr and mrs bridges return to danbury miss harriet hales accompanies them to london on her way to dorsetshire farmer claringbould died this morning and i fancy edward means to get some of his farm if he can cheat sir brook enough in the agreement we have just got some venison from godmersham which the two mr harveys are to dine on tomorrow and on friday or saturday the goodnestone people are to finish their scraps henry went away on friday as he purposed without fayl you will hear from him soon i imagine as he talked of writing to steventon shortly mr richard harvey is going to be married but as it is a great secret and only known to half the neighborhood you must not mention it the ladys name is musgrave i am in great distress i cannot determine whether i shall give richis half a guinea or only five shillings when i go away counsel me amiable miss austen and tell me which will be the most we walked frank last night to crixhall ruff and he appeared much edified little edward was breeched yesterday for good and all and was whipped into the bargain pray remember me to everybody who does not inquire after me those who do remember me without bidding give my love to mary harrison and tell her i wish whenever she is attached to a young man some respectable dr marchmont may keep them apart for five volumes iv rowling thursday september my dear cassandrawe have been very gay since i wrote last dining at nackington returning by moonlight and everything quite in style not to mention mr claringboulds funeral which we saw go by on sunday i believe i told you in a former letter that edward had some idea of taking the name of claringbould but that scheme is over though it would be a very eligible as well as a very pleasant plan would any one advance him money enough to begin on we rather expected mr milles to have done so on tuesday but to our great surprise nothing was said on the subject and unless it is in your power to assist your brother with five or six hundred pounds he must entirely give up the idea at nackington we met lady sondes picture over the mantelpiece in the diningroom and the pictures of her three children in an anteroom besides mr scott miss fletcher mr toke mr j toke and the archdeacon lynch miss fletcher and i were very thick but i am the thinnest of the two she wore her purple muslin which is pretty enough though it does not become her complexion there are two traits in her character which are pleasingnamely she admires camilla and drinks no cream in her tea if you should ever see lucy you may tell her that i scolded miss fletcher for her negligence in writing as she desired me to do but without being able to bring her to any proper sense of shamethat miss fletcher says in her defence that as everybody whom lucy knew when she was in canterbury has now left it she has nothing at all to write to her about by everybody i suppose miss fletcher means that a new set of officers have arrived there but this is a note of my own mrs milles mr john toke and in short everybody of any sensibility inquired in tender strains after you and i took an opportunity of assuring mr j t that neither he nor his father need longer keep themselves single for you we went in our two carriages to nackington but how we divided i shall leave you to surmise merely observing that as elizabeth and i were without either hat or bonnet it would not have been very convenient for us to go in the chaise we went by bifrons and i contemplated with a melancholy pleasure the abode of him on whom i once fondly doated we dine today at goodnestone to meet my aunt fielding from margate and a mr clayton her professed admirerat least so i imagine lady bridges has received very good accounts of marianne who is already certainly the better for her bathing so his royal highness sir thomas williams has at length sailed the papers say on a cruise but i hope they are gone to cork or i shall have written in vain give my love to jane as she arrived at steventon yesterday i dare say i sent a message to mr digweed from edward in a letter to mary lloyd which she ought to receive today but as i know that the harwoods are not very exact as to their letters i may as well repeat it to you mr digweed is to be informed that illness has prevented sewards coming over to look at the repairs intended at the farm but that he will come as soon as he can mr digweed may also be informed if you think proper that mr and mrs milles are to dine here tomorrow and that mrs joan knatchbull is to be asked to meet them mr richard harveys match is put off till he has got a better christian name of which he has great hopes mr childrens two sons are both going to be married john and george they are to have one wife between them a miss holwell who belongs to the black hole at calcutta i depend on hearing from james very soon he promised me an account of the ball and by this time he must have collected his ideas enough after the fatigue of dancing to give me one edward and fly went out yesterday very early in a couple of shooting jackets and came home like a couple of bad shots for they killed nothing at all they are out again today and are not yet returned delightful sport they are just come home edward with his two brace frank with his two and a half what amiable young men fridayyour letter and one from henry are just come and the contents of both accord with my scheme more than i had dared expect in one particular i could wish it otherwise for henry is very indifferent indeed you must not expect us quite so early however as wednesday the thon that day sennight according to our present plan we may be with you frank had never any idea of going away before monday the th i shall write to miss mason immediately and press her returning with us which henry thinks very likely and particularly eligible buy mary harrisons gown by all means you shall have mine for ever so much money though if i am tolerably rich when i get home i shall like it very much myself as to the mode of our travelling to town i want to go in a stagecoach but frank will not let me as you are likely to have the williams and lloyds with you next week you would hardly find room for us then if any one wants anything in town they must send their commissions to frank as i shall merely pass through it the tallowchandler is penlington at the crown and beehive charles street covent garden miss austen steventon overton hants v rowling sunday september my dear cassandrathis morning has been spent in doubt and deliberation in forming plans and removing difficulties for it ushered in the day with an event which i had not intended should take place so soon by a week frank has received his appointment on board the captain john gore commanded by the triton and will therefore be obliged to be in town on wednesday and though i have every disposition in the world to accompany him on that day i cannot go on the uncertainty of the pearsons being at home as i should not have a place to go to in case they were from home i wrote to miss p on friday and hoped to receive an answer from her this morning which would have rendered everything smooth and easy and would have enabled us to leave this place tomorrow as frank on first receiving his appointment intended to do he remains till wednesday merely to accommodate me i have written to her again today and desired her to answer it by return of post on tuesday therefore i shall positively know whether they can receive me on wednesday if they cannot edward has been so good as to promise to take me to greenwich on the monday following which was the day before fixed on if that suits them better if i have no answer at all on tuesday i must suppose mary is not at home and must wait till i do hear as after having invited her to go to steventon with me it will not quite do to go home and say no more about it my father will be so good as to fetch home his prodigal daughter from town i hope unless he wishes me to walk the hospitals enter at the temple or mount guard at st james it will hardly be in franks power to take me homenay it certainly will not i shall write again as soon as i get to greenwich what dreadful hot weather we have it keeps one in a continual state of inelegance if miss pearson should return with me pray be careful not to expect too much beauty i will not pretend to say that on a first view she quite answered the opinion i had formed of her my mother i am sure will be disappointed if she does not take great care from what i remember of her picture it is no great resemblance i am very glad that the idea of returning with frank occurred to me for as to henrys coming into kent again the time of its taking place is so very uncertain that i should be waiting for dead mens shoes i had once determined to go with frank tomorrow and take my chance etc but they dissuaded me from so rash a step as i really think on consideration it would have been for if the pearsons were not at home i should inevitably fall a sacrifice to the arts of some fat woman who would make me drunk with small beer mary is brought to bed of a boyboth doing very well i shall leave you to guess what mary i mean adieu with best love to all your agreeable inmates dont let the lloyds go on any account before i return unless miss p is of the party how ill i have written i begin to hate myself yours ever j austen the triton is a new frigate just launched at deptford frank is much pleased with the prospect of having captain gore under his command miss austen steventon overton hants vi bull and george dartford wednesday october my dear cassandrayou have already heard from daniel i conclude in what excellent time we reached and quitted sittingbourne and how very well my mother bore her journey thither i am now able to send you a continuation of the same good account of her she was very little fatigued on her arrival at this place has been refreshed by a comfortable dinner and now seems quite stout it wanted five minutes of twelve when we left sittingbourne from whence we had a famous pair of horses which took us to rochester in an hour and a quarter the postboy seemed determined to show my mother that kentish drivers were not always tedious and really drove as fast as cax our next stage was not quite so expeditiously performed the road was heavy and our horses very indifferent however we were in such good time and my mother bore her journey so well that expedition was of little importance to us and as it was we were very little more than two hours and a half coming hither and it was scarcely past four when we stopped at the inn my mother took some of her bitters at ospringe and some more at rochester and she ate some bread several times we have got apartments up two pair of stairs as we could not be otherwise accommodated with a sittingroom and bedchambers on the same floor which we wished to be we have one doublebedded and one singlebedded room in the former my mother and i are to sleep i shall leave you to guess who is to occupy the other we sate down to dinner a little after five and had some beefsteaks and a boiled fowl but no oyster sauce i should have begun my letter soon after our arrival but for a little adventure which prevented me after we had been here a quarter of an hour it was discovered that my writing and dressing boxes had been by accident put into a chaise which was just packing off as we came in and were driven away toward gravesend in their way to the west indies no part of my property could have been such a prize before for in my writingbox was all my worldly wealth l and my dear harrys deputation mr nottley immediately despatched a man and horse after the chaise and in half an hours time i had the pleasure of being as rich as ever they were got about two or three miles off my days journey has been pleasanter in every respect than i expected i have been very little crowded and by no means unhappy your watchfulness with regard to the weather on our accounts was very kind and very effectual we had one heavy shower on leaving sittingbourne but afterwards the clouds cleared away and we had a very bright chrystal afternoon my father is now reading the midnight bell which he has got from the library and mother sitting by the fire our route tomorrow is not determined we have none of us much inclination for london and if mr nottley will give us leave i think we shall go to staines through croydon and kingston which will be much pleasanter than any other way but he is decidedly for clapham and battersea god bless you all yours affectionately j a i flatter myself that itty dordy will not forget me at least under a week kiss him for me miss austen godmersham park faversham vii steventon saturday october my dear cassandrayour letter was a most agreeable surprise to me today and i have taken a long sheet of paper to show my gratitude we arrived here yesterday between four and five but i cannot send you quite so triumphant an account of our last days journey as of the first and second soon after i had finished my letter from staines my mother began to suffer from the exercise or fatigue of travelling and she was a good deal indisposed she had not a very good night at staines but bore her journey better than i had expected and at basingstoke where we stopped more than half an hour received much comfort from a mess of broth and the sight of mr lyford who recommended her to take twelve drops of laudanum when she went to bed as a composer which she accordingly did james called on us just as we were going to tea and my mother was well enough to talk very cheerfully to him before she went to bed james seems to have taken to his old trick of coming to steventon in spite of marys reproaches for he was here before breakfast and is now paying us a second visit they were to have dined here today but the weather is too bad i have had the pleasure of hearing that martha is with them james fetched her from ibthorp on thursday and she will stay with them till she removes to kintbury we met with no adventures at all in our journey yesterday except that our trunk had once nearly slipped off and we were obliged to stop at hartley to have our wheels greased whilst my mother and mr lyford were together i went to mrs ryders and bought what i intended to buy but not in much perfection there were no narrow braces for children and scarcely any notting silk but miss wood as usual is going to town very soon and will lay in a fresh stock i gave s d a yard for my flannel and i fancy it is not very good but it is so disgraceful and contemptible an article in itself that its being comparatively good or bad is of little importance i bought some japan ink likewise and next week shall begin my operations on my hat on which you know my principal hopes of happiness depend i am very grand indeed i had the dignity of dropping out my mothers laudanum last night i carry about the keys of the wine and closet and twice since i began this letter have had orders to give in the kitchen our dinner was very good yesterday and the chicken boiled perfectly tender therefore i shall not be obliged to dismiss nanny on that account almost everything was unpacked and put away last night nanny chose to do it and i was not sorry to be busy i have unpacked the gloves and placed yours in your drawer their color is light and pretty and i believe exactly what we fixed on your letter was chaperoned here by one from mrs cooke in which she says that battleridge is not to come out before january and she is so little satisfied with cawthorns dilatoriness that she never means to employ him again mrs hall of sherborne was brought to bed yesterday of a dead child some weeks before she expected owing to a fright i suppose she happened unawares to look at her husband there has been a great deal of rain here for this last fortnight much more than in kent and indeed we found the roads all the way from staines most disgracefully dirty steventon lane has its full share of it and i dont know when i shall be able to get to deane i hear that martha is in better looks and spirits than she has enjoyed for a long time and i flatter myself she will now be able to jest openly about mr w the spectacles which molly found are my mothers the scissors my fathers we are very glad to hear such a good account of your patients little and great my dear itty dordys remembrance of me is very pleasing to mefoolishly pleasing because i know it will be over so soon my attachment to him will be more durable i shall think with tenderness and delight on his beautiful and smiling countenance and interesting manner until a few years have turned him into an ungovernable ungracious fellow the books from winton are all unpacked and put away the binding has compressed them most conveniently and there is now very good room in the bookcase for all that we wish to have there i believe the servants were very glad to see us nanny was i am sure she confesses that it was very dull and yet she had her child with her till last sunday i understand that there are some grapes left but i believe not many they must be gathered as soon as possible or this rain will entirely rot them i am quite angry with myself for not writing closer why is my alphabet so much more sprawly than yours dame tilburys daughter has lain in shall i give her any of your baby clothes the laceman was here only a few days ago how unfortunate for both of us that he came so soon dame bushell washes for us only one week more as sukey has got a place john steevens wife undertakes our purification she does not look as if anything she touched would ever be clean but who knows we do not seem likely to have any other maidservant at present but dame staples will supply the place of one mary has hired a young girl from ashe who has never been out to service to be her scrub but james fears her not being strong enough for the place earle harwood has been to deane lately as i think mary wrote us word and his family then told him that they would receive his wife if she continued to behave well for another year he was very grateful as well he might their behavior throughout the whole affair has been particularly kind earle and his wife live in the most private manner imaginable at portsmouth without keeping a servant of any kind what a prodigious innate love of virtue she must have to marry under such circumstances it is now saturday evening but i wrote the chief of this in the morning my mother has not been down at all today the laudanum made her sleep a good deal and upon the whole i think she is better my father and i dined by ourselves how strange he and john bond are now very happy together for i have just heard the heavy step of the latter along the passage james digweed called today and i gave him his brothers deputation charles harwood too has just called to ask how we are in his way from dummer whither he has been conveying miss garrett who is going to return to her former residence in kent i will leave off or i shall not have room to add a word tomorrow sundaymy mother has had a very good night and feels much better today i have received my aunts letter and thank you for your scrap i will write to charles soon pray give fanny and edward a kiss from me and ask george if he has got a new song for me tis really very kind of my aunt to ask us to bath again a kindness that deserves a better return than to profit by it yours ever j a miss austen godmersham park faversham kent viii steventon december my dear cassandrai am so good as to write to you again thus speedily to let you know that i have just heard from frank he was at cadiz alive and well on october and had then very lately received a letter from you written as long ago as when the london was at st helens but his raly latest intelligence of us was in one from me of september which i sent soon after we got to godmersham he had written a packet full for his dearest friends in england early in october to go by the excellent but the excellent was not sailed nor likely to sail when he despatched this to me it comprehended letters for both of us for lord spencer mr daysh and the east india directors lord st vincent had left the fleet when he wrote and was gone to gibraltar it was said to superintend the fitting out of a private expedition from thence against some of the enemies ports minorca or malta were conjectured to be the objects frank writes in good spirits but says that our correspondence cannot be so easily carried on in future as it has been as the communication between cadiz and lisbon is less frequent than formerly you and my mother therefore must not alarm yourselves at the long intervals that may divide his letters i address this advice to you two as being the most tenderhearted of the family my mother made her entrée into the dressingroom through crowds of admiring spectators yesterday afternoon and we all drank tea together for the first time these five weeks she has had a tolerable night and bids fair for a continuance in the same brilliant course of action today mr lyford was here yesterday he came while we were at dinner and partook of our elegant entertainment i was not ashamed at asking him to sit down to table for we had some peasesoup a sparerib and a pudding he wants my mother to look yellow and to throw out a rash but she will do neither i was at deane yesterday morning mary was very well but does not gain bodily strength very fast when i saw her so stout on the third and sixth days i expected to have seen her as well as ever by the end of a fortnight james went to ibthorp yesterday to see his mother and child letty is with mary at present of course exceedingly happy and in raptures with the child mary does not manage matters in such a way as to make me want to lay in myself she is not tidy enough in her appearance she has no dressinggown to sit up in her curtains are all too thin and things are not in that comfort and style about her which are necessary to make such a situation an enviable one elizabeth was really a pretty object with her nice clean cap put on so tidily and her dress so uniformly white and orderly we live entirely in the dressingroom now which i like very much i always feel so much more elegant in it than in the parlor no news from kintbury yet eliza sports with our impatience she was very well last thursday who is miss maria montresor going to marry and what is to become of miss mulcaster i find great comfort in my stuff gown but i hope you do not wear yours too often i have made myself two or three caps to wear of evenings since i came home and they save me a world of torment as to hairdressing which at present gives me no trouble beyond washing and brushing for my long hair is always plaited up out of sight and my short hair curls well enough to want no papering i have had it cut lately by mr butler there is no reason to suppose that miss morgan is dead after all mr lyford gratified us very much yesterday by his praises of my fathers mutton which they all think the finest that was ever ate john bond begins to find himself grow old which john bonds ought not to do and unequal to much hard work a man is therefore hired to supply his place as to labor and john himself is to have the care of the sheep there are not more people engaged than before i believe only men instead of boys i fancy so at least but you know my stupidity as to such matters lizzie bond is just apprenticed to miss small so we may hope to see her able to spoil gowns in a few years my father has applied to mr may for an alehouse for robert at his request and to mr deane of winchester likewise this was my mothers idea who thought he would be proud to oblige a relation of edward in return for edwards accepting his money he sent a very civil answer indeed but has no house vacant at present may expects to have an empty one soon at farnham so perhaps nanny may have the honor of drawing ale for the bishop i shall write to frank tomorrow charles powlett gave a dance on thursday to the great disturbance of all his neighbors of course who you know take a most lively interest in the state of his finances and live in hopes of his being soon ruined we are very much disposed to like our new maid she knows nothing of a dairy to be sure which in our family is rather against her but she is to be taught it all in short we have felt the inconvenience of being without a maid so long that we are determined to like her and she will find it a hard matter to displease us as yet she seems to cook very well is uncommonly stout and says she can work well at her needle sundaymy father is glad to hear so good an account of edwards pigs and desires he may be told as encouragement to his taste for them that lord bolton is particularly curious in his pigs has had pigstyes of a most elegant construction built for them and visits them every morning as soon as he rises affectionately yours j a miss austen godmersham park faversham footnote mrs james austen ix steventon tuesday december my dear cassandrayour letter came quite as soon as i expected and so your letters will always do because i have made it a rule not to expect them till they come in which i think i consult the ease of us both it is a great satisfaction to us to hear that your business is in a way to be settled and so settled as to give you as little inconvenience as possible you are very welcome to my fathers name and to his services if they are ever required in it i shall keep my ten pounds too to wrap myself up in next winter i took the liberty a few days ago of asking your black velvet bonnet to lend me its cawl which it very readily did and by which i have been enabled to give a considerable improvement of dignity to cap which was before too nidgetty to please me i shall wear it on thursday but i hope you will not be offended with me for following your advice as to its ornaments only in part i still venture to retain the narrow silver round it put twice round without any bow and instead of the black military feather shall put in the coquelicot one as being smarter and besides coquelicot is to be all the fashion this winter after the ball i shall probably make it entirely black i am sorry that our dear charles begins to feel the dignity of illusage my father will write to admiral gambier he must have already received so much satisfaction from his acquaintance and patronage of frank that he will be delighted i dare say to have another of the family introduced to him i think it would be very right in charles to address sir thomas on the occasion though i cannot approve of your scheme of writing to him which you communicated to me a few nights ago to request him to come home and convey you to steventon to do you justice however you had some doubts of the propriety of such a measure yourself i am very much obliged to my dear little george for his messagefor his love at least his duty i suppose was only in consequence of some hint of my favorable intentions towards him from his father or mother i am sincerely rejoiced however that i ever was born since it has been the means of procuring him a dish of tea give my best love to him wednesdayi have changed my mind and changed the trimmings of my cap this morning they are now such as you suggested i felt as if i should not prosper if i strayed from your directions and i think it makes me look more like lady conyngham now than it did before which is all that one lives for now i believe i shall make my new gown like my robe but the back of the latter is all in a piece with the tail and will seven yards enable me to copy it in that respect i have just heard from martha and frank his letter was written on november all well and nothing particular j a miss austen godmersham park faversham x steventon monday night december my dear cassandrai have got some pleasant news for you which i am eager to communicate and therefore begin my letter sooner though i shall not send it sooner than usual admiral gambier in reply to my fathers application writes as follows as it is usual to keep young officers in small vessels it being most proper on account of their inexperience and it being also a situation where they are more in the way of learning their duty your son has been continued in the scorpion but i have mentioned to the board of admiralty his wish to be in a frigate and when a proper opportunity offers and it is judged that he has taken his turn in a small ship i hope he will be removed with regard to your son now in the london i am glad i can give you the assurance that his promotion is likely to take place very soon as lord spencer has been so good as to say he would include him in an arrangement that he proposes making in a short time relative to some promotions in that quarter there i may now finish my letter and go and hang myself for i am sure i can neither write nor do anything which will not appear insipid to you after this now i really think he will soon be made and only wish we could communicate our foreknowledge of the event to him whom it principally concerns my father has written to daysh to desire that he will inform us if he can when the commission is sent your chief wish is now ready to be accomplished and could lord spencer give happiness to martha at the same time what a joyful heart he would make of yours i have sent the same extract of the sweets of gambier to charles who poor fellow though he sinks into nothing but an humble attendant on the hero of the piece will i hope be contented with the prospect held out to him by what the admiral says it appears as if he had been designedly kept in the scorpion but i will not torment myself with conjectures and suppositions facts shall satisfy me frank had not heard from any of us for ten weeks when he wrote to me on november in consequence of lord st vincent being removed to gibraltar when his commission is sent however it will not be so long on its road as our letters because all the government despatches are forwarded by land to his lordship from lisbon with great regularity i returned from manydown this morning and found my mother certainly in no respect worse than when i left her she does not like the cold weather but that we cannot help i spent my time very quietly and very pleasantly with catherine miss blackford is agreeable enough i do not want people to be very agreeable as it saves me the trouble of liking them a great deal i found only catherine and her when i got to manydown on thursday we dined together and went together to worting to seek the protection of mrs clarke with whom were lady mildmay her eldest son and mr and mrs hoare our ball was very thin but by no means unpleasant there were thirtyone people and only eleven ladies out of the number and but five single women in the room of the gentlemen present you may have some idea from the list of my partnersmr wood g lefroy rice a mr butcher belonging to the temples a sailor and not of the th light dragoons mr temple not the horrid one of all mr wm orde cousin to the kingsclere man mr john harwood and mr calland who appeared as usual with his hat in his hand and stood every now and then behind catherine and me to be talked to and abused for not dancing we teased him however into it at last i was very glad to see him again after so long a separation and he was altogether rather the genius and flirt of the evening he inquired after you there were twenty dances and i danced them all and without any fatigue i was glad to find myself capable of dancing so much and with so much satisfaction as i did from my slender enjoyment of the ashford balls as assemblies for dancing i had not thought myself equal to it but in cold weather and with few couples i fancy i could just as well dance for a week together as for half an hour my black cap was openly admired by mrs lefroy and secretly i imagine by everybody else in the room poor edward it is very hard that he who has everything else in the world that he can wish for should not have good health too but i hope with the assistance of stomach complaints faintnesses and sicknesses he will soon be restored to that blessing likewise if his nervous complaint proceeded from a suppression of something that ought to be thrown out which does not seem unlikely the first of these disorders may really be a remedy and i sincerely wish it may for i know no one more deserving of happiness without alloy than edward is the lords of the admiralty will have enough of our applications at present for i hear from charles that he has written to lord spencer himself to be removed i am afraid his serene highness will be in a passion and order some of our heads to be cut off you deserve a longer letter than this but it is my unhappy fate seldom to treat people so well as they deserve god bless you yours affectionately jane austen wednesdaythe snow came to nothing yesterday so i did go to deane and returned home at nine oclock at night in the little carriage and without being very cold miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xi steventon friday december my dear cassandrafrank is made he was yesterday raised to the rank of commander and appointed to the petterel sloop now at gibraltar a letter from daysh has just announced this and as it is confirmed by a very friendly one from mr mathew to the same effect transcribing one from admiral gambier to the general we have no reason to suspect the truth of it as soon as you have cried a little for joy you may go on and learn further that the india house have taken captain austens petition into considerationthis comes from dayshand likewise that lieutenant charles john austen is removed to the tamar frigatethis comes from the admiral we cannot find out where the tamar is but i hope we shall now see charles here at all events this letter is to be dedicated entirely to good news if you will send my father an account of your washing and letter expenses etc he will send you a draft for the amount of it as well as for your next quarter and for edwards rent if you dont buy a muslin gown now on the strength of this money and franks promotion i shall never forgive you mrs lefroy has just sent me word that lady dorchester meant to invite me to her ball on january which though an humble blessing compared with what the last page records i do not consider as any calamity i cannot write any more now but i have written enough to make you very happy and therefore may safely conclude yours affectionately jane miss austen godmersham park xii steventon tuesday january my dear cassandrayou must read your letters over five times in future before you send them and then perhaps you may find them as entertaining as i do i laughed at several parts of the one which i am now answering charles is not come yet but he must come this morning or he shall never know what i will do to him the ball at kempshott is this evening and i have got him an invitation though i have not been so considerate as to get him a partner but the cases are different between him and eliza bailey for he is not in a dying way and may therefore be equal to getting a partner for himself i believe i told you that monday was to be the ball night for which and for all other errors into which i may ever have led you i humbly ask your pardon elizabeth is very cruel about my writing music and as a punishment for her i should insist upon always writing out all hers for her in future if i were not punishing myself at the same time i am tolerably glad to hear that edwards income is so good a oneas glad as i can be at anybodys being rich except you and meand i am thoroughly rejoiced to hear of his present to you i am not to wear my white satin cap tonight after all i am to wear a mamalone cap instead which charles fowle sent to mary and which she lends me it is all the fashion now worn at the opera and by lady mildmays at hackwood balls i hate describing such things and i dare say you will be able to guess what it is like i have got over the dreadful epocha of mantuamaking much better than i expected my gown is made very much like my blue one which you always told me sat very well with only these variations the sleeves are short the wrap fuller the apron comes over it and a band of the same completes the whole i assure you that i dread the idea of going to brighton as much as you do but i am not without hopes that something may happen to prevent it f has lost his election at b and perhaps they may not be able to see company for some time they talk of going to bath too in the spring and perhaps they may be overturned in their way down and all laid up for the summer wednesdayi have had a cold and weakness in one of my eyes for some days which makes writing neither very pleasant nor very profitable and which will probably prevent my finishing this letter myself my mother has undertaken to do it for me and i shall leave the kempshott ball for her you express so little anxiety about my being murdered under ash park copse by mrs hulberts servant that i have a great mind not to tell you whether i was or not and shall only say that i did not return home that night or the next as martha kindly made room for me in her bed which was the shutup one in the new nursery nurse and the child slept upon the floor and there we all were in some confusion and great comfort the bed did exceedingly well for us both to lie awake in and talk till two oclock and to sleep in the rest of the night i love martha better than ever and i mean to go and see her if i can when she gets home we all dined at the harwoods on thursday and the party broke up the next morning this complaint in my eye has been a sad bore to me for i have not been able to read or work in any comfort since friday but one advantage will be derived from it for i shall be such a proficient in music by the time i have got rid of my cold that i shall be perfectly qualified in that science at least to take mr roopes office at eastwell next summer and i am sure of elizabeths recommendation be it only on harriets account of my talent in drawing i have given specimens in my letters to you and i have nothing to do but to invent a few hard names for the stars mary grows rather more reasonable about her childs beauty and says that she does not think him really handsome but i suspect her moderation to be something like that of w ws mamma perhaps mary has told you that they are going to enter more into dinnerparties the biggs and mr holder dine there tomorrow and i am to meet them i shall sleep there catherine has the honor of giving her name to a set which will be composed of two withers two heathcotes a blackford and no bigg except herself she congratulated me last night on franks promotion as if she really felt the joy she talked of my sweet little george i am delighted to hear that he has such an inventive genius as to facemaking i admired his yellow wafer very much and hope he will choose the wafer for your next letter i wore my green shoes last night and took my white fan with me i am very glad he never threw it into the river mrs knight giving up the godmersham estate to edward was no such prodigious act of generosity after all it seems for she has reserved herself an income out of it still this ought to be known that her conduct may not be overrated i rather think edward shows the most magnanimity of the two in accepting her resignation with such incumbrances the more i write the better my eye gets so i shall at least keep on till it is quite well before i give up my pen to my mother mrs bramstons little movable apartment was tolerably filled last night by herself mrs h blackstone her two daughters and me i do not like the miss blackstones indeed i was always determined not to like them so there is the less merit in it mrs bramston was very civil kind and noisy i spent a very pleasant evening chiefly among the manydown party there was the same kind of supper as last year and the same want of chairs there were more dancers than the room could conveniently hold which is enough to constitute a good ball at any time i do not think i was very much in request people were rather apt not to ask me till they could not help it ones consequence you know varies so much at times without any particular reason there was one gentleman an officer of the cheshire a very goodlooking young man who i was told wanted very much to be introduced to me but as he did not want it quite enough to take much trouble in effecting it we never could bring it about i danced with mr john wood again twice with a mr south a lad from winchester who i suppose is as far from being related to the bishop of that diocese as it is possible to be with g lefroy and j harwood who i think takes to me rather more than he used to do one of my gayest actions was sitting down two dances in preference to having lord boltons eldest son for my partner who danced too ill to be endured the miss charterises were there and played the parts of the miss edens with great spirit charles never came naughty charles i suppose he could not get superseded in time miss debary has replaced your two sheets of drawingpaper with two of superior size and quality so i do not grudge her having taken them at all now mr ludlow and miss pugh of andover are lately married and so is mrs skeete of basingstoke and mr french chemist of reading i do not wonder at your wanting to read first impressions again so seldom as you have gone through it and that so long ago i am much obliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat behind you i have long secretly wished it might be done but had not courage to make the request pray mention the name of maria montresors lover when you write next my mother wants to know it and i have not courage to look back into your letters to find it out i shall not be able to send this till tomorrow and you will be disappointed on friday i am very sorry for it but i cannot help it the partnership between jeffereys toomer and legge is dissolved the two latter are melted away into nothing and it is to be hoped that jeffereys will soon break for the sake of a few heroines whose money he may have i wish you joy of your birthday twenty times over i shall be able to send this to the post today which exalts me to the utmost pinnacle of human felicity and makes me bask in the sunshine of prosperity or gives me any other sensation of pleasure in studied language which you may prefer do not be angry with me for not filling my sheet and believe me yours affectionately j a miss austen godmersham park faversham xiii steventon monday january my dear cassandrai will endeavor to make this letter more worthy your acceptance than my last which was so shabby a one that i think mr marshall could never charge you with the postage my eyes have been very indifferent since it was written but are now getting better once more keeping them so many hours open on thursday night as well as the dust of the ballroom injured them a good deal i use them as little as i can but you know and elizabeth knows and everybody who ever had weak eyes knows how delightful it is to hurt them by employment against the advice and entreaty of all ones friends charles leaves us tonight the tamar is in the downs and mr daysh advises him to join her there directly as there is no chance of her going to the westward charles does not approve of this at all and will not be much grieved if he should be too late for her before she sails as he may then hope to get into a better station he attempted to go to town last night and got as far on his road thither as dean gate but both the coaches were full and we had the pleasure of seeing him back again he will call on daysh tomorrow to know whether the tamar has sailed or not and if she is still at the downs he will proceed in one of the night coaches to deal i want to go with him that i may explain the country to him properly between canterbury and rowling but the unpleasantness of returning by myself deters me i should like to go as far as ospringe with him very much indeed that i might surprise you at godmersham martha writes me word that charles was very much admired at kintbury and mrs lefroy never saw any one so much improved in her life and thinks him handsomer than henry he appears to far more advantage here than he did at godmersham not surrounded by strangers and neither oppressed by a pain in his face or powder in his hair james christened elizabeth caroline on saturday morning and then came home mary anna and edward have left us of course before the second went i took down her answer to her cousin fanny yesterday came a letter to my mother from edward cooper to announce not the birth of a child but of a living for mrs leigh has begged his acceptance of the rectory of hamstallridware in staffordshire vacant by mr johnsons death we collect from his letter that he means to reside there in which he shows his wisdom staffordshire is a good way off so we shall see nothing more of them till some fifteen years hence the miss coopers are presented to us fine jolly handsome ignorant girls the living is valued at l a year but perhaps it may be improvable how will they be able to convey the furniture of the dressingroom so far in safety our first cousins seem all dropping off very fast one is incorporated into the family another dies and a third goes into staffordshire we can learn nothing of the disposal of the other living i have not the smallest notion of fulwars having it lord craven has probably other connections and more intimate ones in that line than he now has with the kintbury family our ball on thursday was a very poor one only eight couple and but twentythree people in the room but it was not the balls fault for we were deprived of two or three families by the sudden illness of mr wither who was seized that morning at winchester with a return of his former alarming complaint an express was sent off from thence to the family catherine and miss blackford were dining with mrs russell poor catherines distress must have been very great she was prevailed on to wait till the heathcotes could come from wintney and then with those two and harris proceeded directly to winchester in such a disorder his danger i suppose must always be great but from this attack he is now rapidly recovering and will be well enough to return to manydown i fancy in a few days it was a fine thing for conversation at the ball but it deprived us not only of the biggs but of mrs russell too and of the boltons and john harwood who were dining there likewise and of mr lane who kept away as related to the family poor mani mean mr witherhis life is so useful his character so respectable and worthy that i really believe there was a good deal of sincerity in the general concern expressed on his account our ball was chiefly made up of jervoises and terrys the former of whom were apt to be vulgar the latter to be noisy i had an odd set of partners mr jenkins mr street colonel jervoise james digweed j lyford and mr briggs a friend of the latter i had a very pleasant evening however though you will probably find out that there was no particular reason for it but i do not think it worth while to wait for enjoyment until there is some real opportunity for it mary behaved very well and was not at all fidgetty for the history of her adventures at the ball i refer you to annas letter when you come home you will have some shirts to make up for charles mrs davies frightened him into buying a piece of irish when we were in basingstoke mr daysh supposes that captain austens commission has reached him by this time tuesdayyour letter has pleased and amused me very much your essay on happy fortnights is highly ingenious and the talobert skin made me laugh a good deal whenever i fall into misfortune how many jokes it ought to furnish to my acquaintance in general or i shall die dreadfully in their debt for entertainment it began to occur to me before you mentioned it that i had been somewhat silent as to my mothers health for some time but i thought you could have no difficulty in divining its exact stateyou who have guessed so much stranger things she is tolerably wellbetter upon the whole than she was some weeks ago she would tell you herself that she has a very dreadful cold in her head at present but i have not much compassion for colds in the head without fever or sore throat our own particular little brother got a place in the coach last night and is now i suppose in town i have no objection at all to your buying our gowns there as your imagination has pictured to you exactly such a one as is necessary to make me happy you quite abash me by your progress in notting for i am still without silk you must get me some in town or in canterbury it should be finer than yours i thought edward would not approve of charles being a crop and rather wished you to conceal it from him at present lest it might fall on his spirits and retard his recovery my father furnishes him with a pig from cheesedown it is already killed and cut up but it is not to weigh more than nine stone the season is too far advanced to get him a larger one my mother means to pay herself for the salt and the trouble of ordering it to be cured by the spareribs the souse and the lard we have had one dead lamb i congratulate you on mr e hattons good fortune i suppose the marriage will now follow out of hand give my compliments to miss finch what time in march may we expect your return in i begin to be very tired of answering peoples questions on that subject and independent of that i shall be very glad to see you at home again and then if we can get martha and shirk who will be so happy as we i think of going to ibthorp in about a fortnight my eyes are pretty well i thank you if you please wednesday di wish my dear fanny many returns of this day and that she may on every return enjoy as much pleasure as she is now receiving from her dollsbeds i have just heard from charles who is by this time at deal he is to be second lieutenant which pleases him very well the endymion is come into the downs which pleases him likewise he expects to be ordered to sheerness shortly as the tamar has never been refitted my father and mother made the same match for you last night and are very much pleased with it he is a beauty of my mothers yours affectionately jane miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xiv queens square friday may my dearest cassandraour journey yesterday went off exceedingly well nothing occurred to alarm or delay us we found the roads in excellent order had very good horses all the way and reached devizes with ease by four oclock i suppose john has told you in what manner we were divided when we left andover and no alteration was afterwards made at devizes we had comfortable rooms and a good dinner to which we sat down about five amongst other things we had asparagus and a lobster which made me wish for you and some cheesecakes on which the children made so delightful a supper as to endear the town of devizes to them for a long time well here we are at bath we got here about one oclock and have been arrived just long enough to go over the house fix on our rooms and be very well pleased with the whole of it poor elizabeth has had a dismal ride of it from devizes for it has rained almost all the way and our first view of bath has been just as gloomy as it was last november twelvemonth i have got so many things to say so many things equally important that i know not on which to decide at present and shall therefore go and eat with the children we stopped in paragon as we came along but as it was too wet and dirty for us to get out we could only see frank who told us that his master was very indifferent but had had a better night last night than usual in paragon we met mrs foley and mrs dowdeswell with her yellow shawl airing out and at the bottom of kingsdown hill we met a gentleman in a buggy who on minute examination turned out to be dr halland dr hall in such very deep mourning that either his mother his wife or himself must be dead these are all of our acquaintance who have yet met our eyes i have some hopes of being plagued about my trunk i had more a few hours ago for it was too heavy to go by the coach which brought thomas and rebecca from devizes there was reason to suppose that it might be too heavy likewise for any other coach and for a long time we could hear of no wagon to convey it at last however we unluckily discovered that one was just on the point of setting out for this place but at any rate the trunk cannot be here till tomorrow so far we are safe and who knows what may not happen to procure a further delay i put marys letter into the postoffice at andover with my own hand we are exceedingly pleased with the house the rooms are quite as large as we expected mrs bromley is a fat woman in mourning and a little black kitten runs about the staircase elizabeth has the apartment within the drawingroom she wanted my mother to have it but as there was no bed in the inner one and the stairs are so much easier of ascent or my mother so much stronger than in paragon as not to regard the double flight it is settled for us to be above where we have two very nicesized rooms with dirty quilts and everything comfortable i have the outward and larger apartment as i ought to have which is quite as large as our bedroom at home and my mothers is not materially less the beds are both as large as any at steventon and i have a very nice chest of drawers and a closet full of shelvesso full indeed that there is nothing else in it and it should therefore be called a cupboard rather than a closet i suppose tell mary that there were some carpenters at work in the inn at devizes this morning but as i could not be sure of their being mrs w fowles relations i did not make myself known to them i hope it will be a tolerable afternoon when first we came all the umbrellas were up but now the pavements are getting very white again my mother does not seem at all the worse for her journey nor are any of us i hope though edward seemed rather fagged last night and not very brisk this morning but i trust the bustle of sending for tea coffee and sugar etc and going out to taste a cheese himself will do him good there was a very long list of arrivals here in the newspaper yesterday so that we need not immediately dread absolute solitude and there is a public breakfast in sydney gardens every morning so that we shall not be wholly starved elizabeth has just had a very good account of the three little boys i hope you are very busy and very comfortable i find no difficulty in closing my eyes i like our situation very much it is far more cheerful than paragon and the prospect from the drawingroom window at which i now write is rather picturesque as it commands a prospective view of the left side of brock street broken by three lombardy poplars in the garden of the last house in queens parade i am rather impatient to know the fate of my best gown but i suppose it will be some days before frances can get through the trunk in the mean time i am with many thanks for your trouble in making it as well as marking my silk stockings yours very affectionately jane a great deal of love from everybody miss austen steventon overton hants xv queen square sunday june my dear cassandrai am obliged to you for two letters one from yourself and the other from mary for of the latter i knew nothing till on the receipt of yours yesterday when the pigeonbasket was examined and i received my due as i have written to her since the time which ought to have brought me hers i suppose she will consider herself as i choose to consider her still in my debt i will lay out all the little judgment i have in endeavoring to get such stockings for anna as she will approve but i do not know that i shall execute marthas commission at all for i am not fond of ordering shoes and at any rate they shall all have flat heels what must i tell you of edward truth or falsehood i will try the former and you may choose for yourself another time he was better yesterday than he had been for two or three days beforeabout as well as while he was at steventon he drinks at the hetling pump is to bathe tomorrow and try electricity on tuesday he proposed the latter himself to dr fellowes who made no objection to it but i fancy we are all unanimous in expecting no advantage from it at present i have no great notion of our staying here beyond the month i heard from charles last week they were to sail on wednesday my mother seems remarkably well my uncle overwalked himself at first and can now only travel in a chair but is otherwise very well my cloak is come home i like it very much and can now exclaim with delight like j bond at hayharvest this is what i have been looking for these three years i saw some gauzes in a shop in bath street yesterday at only d a yard but they were not so good or so pretty as mine flowers are very much worn and fruit is still more the thing elizabeth has a bunch of strawberries and i have seen grapes cherries plums and apricots there are likewise almonds and raisins french plums and tamarinds at the grocers but i have never seen any of them in hats a plum or greengage would cost three shillings cherries and grapes about five i believe but this is at some of the dearest shops my aunt has told me of a very cheap one near walcot church to which i shall go in quest of something for you i have never seen an old woman at the pumproom elizabeth has given me a hat and it is not only a pretty hat but a pretty style of hat too it is something like elizas only instead of being all straw half of it is narrow purple ribbon i flatter myself however that you can understand very little of it from this description heaven forbid that i should ever offer such encouragement to explanations as to give a clear one on any occasion myself but i must write no more of this i spent friday evening with the mapletons and was obliged to submit to being pleased in spite of my inclination we took a very charming walk from six to eight up beacon hill and across some fields to the village of charlecombe which is sweetly situated in a little green valley as a village with such a name ought to be marianne is sensible and intelligent and even jane considering how fair she is is not unpleasant we had a miss north and a mr gould of our party the latter walked home with me after tea he is a very young man just entered oxford wears spectacles and has heard that evelina was written by dr johnson i am afraid i cannot undertake to carry marthas shoes home for though we had plenty of room in our trunks when we came we shall have many more things to take back and i must allow besides for my packing there is to be a grand gala on tuesday evening in sydney gardens a concert with illuminations and fireworks to the latter elizabeth and i look forward with pleasure and even the concert will have more than its usual charm for me as the gardens are large enough for me to get pretty well beyond the reach of its sound in the morning lady willoughby is to present the colors to some corps or yeomanry or other in the crescent and that such festivities may have a proper commencement we think of going to i am quite pleased with martha and mrs lefroy for wanting the pattern of our caps but i am not so well pleased with your giving it to them some wish some prevailing wish is necessary to the animation of everybodys mind and in gratifying this you leave them to form some other which will not probably be half so innocent i shall not forget to write to frank duty and love etc yours affectionately jane my uncle is quite surprised at my hearing from you so often but as long as we can keep the frequency of our correspondence from marthas uncle we will not fear our own miss austen steventon xvi queen square tuesday june my dear cassandrayour letter yesterday made me very happy i am heartily glad that you have escaped any share in the impurities of deane and not sorry as it turns out that our stay here has been lengthened i feel tolerably secure of our getting away next week though it is certainly possible that we may remain till thursday the th i wonder what we shall do with all our intended visits this summer i should like to make a compromise with adlestrop harden and bookham that marthas spending the summer at steventon should be considered as our respective visits to them all edward has been pretty well for this last week and as the waters have never disagreed with him in any respect we are inclined to hope that he will derive advantage from them in the end everybody encourages us in this expectation for they all say that the effect of the waters cannot be negative and many are the instances in which their benefit is felt afterwards more than on the spot he is more comfortable here than i thought he would be and so is elizabeth though they will both i believe be very glad to get awaythe latter especially which one cant wonder at somehow so much for mrs piozzi i had some thoughts of writing the whole of my letter in her style but i believe i shall not though you have given me unlimited powers concerning your sprig i cannot determine what to do about it and shall therefore in this and in every other future letter continue to ask your further directions we have been to the cheap shop and very cheap we found it but there are only flowers made there no fruit and as i could get four or five very pretty sprigs of the former for the same money which would procure only one orleans plumin short could get more for three or four shillings than i could have means of bringing homei cannot decide on the fruit till i hear from you again besides i cannot help thinking that it is more natural to have flowers grow out of the head than fruit what do you think on that subject i would not let martha read first impressions again upon any account and am very glad that i did not leave it in your power she is very cunning but i saw through her design she means to publish it from memory and one more perusal must enable her to do it as for fitzalbini when i get home she shall have it as soon as ever she will own that mr elliott is handsomer than mr lance that fair men are preferable to black for i mean to take every opportunity of rooting out her prejudices benjamin portal is here how charming that is i do not exactly know why but the phrase followed so naturally that i could not help putting it down my mother saw him the other day but without making herself known to him i am very glad you liked my lace and so are you and so is martha and we are all glad together i have got your cloak home which is quite delightfulas delightful at least as half the circumstances which are called so i do not know what is the matter with me today but i cannot write quietly i am always wandering away into some exclamation or other fortunately i have nothing very particular to say we walked to weston one evening last week and liked it very much liked what very much weston no walking to weston i have not expressed myself properly but i hope you will understand me we have not been to any public place lately nor performed anything out of the common daily routine of no queen square bath but today we were to have dashed away at a very extraordinary rate by dining out had it not so happened that we did not go edward renewed his acquaintance lately with mr evelyn who lives in the queens parade and was invited to a family dinner which i believe at first elizabeth was rather sorry at his accepting but yesterday mrs evelyn called on us and her manners were so pleasing that we liked the idea of going very much the biggs would call her a nice woman but mr evelyn who was indisposed yesterday is worse today and we are put off it is rather impertinent to suggest any household care to a housekeeper but i just venture to say that the coffeemill will be wanted every day while edward is at steventon as he always drinks coffee for breakfast fanny desires her love to you her love to grandpapa her love to anna and her love to hannah the latter is particularly to be remembered edward desires his love to you to grandpapa to anna to little edward to aunt james and uncle james and he hopes all your turkeys and ducks and chicken and guinea fowls are very well and he wishes you very much to send him a printed letter and so does fannyand they both rather think they shall answer it dr gardiner was married yesterday to mrs percy and her three daughters now i will give you the history of marys veil in the purchase of which i have so considerably involved you that it is my duty to economize for you in the flowers i had no difficulty in getting a muslin veil for half a guinea and not much more in discovering afterwards that the muslin was thick dirty and ragged and therefore would by no means do for a united gift i changed it consequently as soon as i could and considering what a state my imprudence had reduced me to i thought myself lucky in getting a black lace one for sixteen shillings i hope the half of that sum will not greatly exceed what you had intended to offer upon the altar of sisterinlaw affection yours affectionately jane they do not seem to trouble you much from manydown i have long wanted to quarrel with them and i believe i shall take this opportunity there is no denying that they are very capriciousfor they like to enjoy their elder sisters company when they can miss austen steventon overton hants footnote the title first chosen for pride and prejudice xvii steventon thursday november my dear cassandrayour letter took me quite by surprise this morning you are very welcome however and i am very much obliged to you i believe i drank too much wine last night at hurstbourne i know not how else to account for the shaking of my hand today you will kindly make allowance therefore for any indistinctness of writing by attributing it to this venial error naughty charles did not come on tuesday but good charles came yesterday morning about two oclock he walked in on a gosport hack his feeling equal to such a fatigue is a good sign and his feeling no fatigue in it a still better he walked down to deane to dinner he danced the whole evening and today is no more tired than a gentleman ought to be your desiring to hear from me on sunday will perhaps bring you a more particular account of the ball than you may care for because one is prone to think much more of such things the morning after they happen than when time has entirely driven them out of ones recollection it was a pleasant evening charles found it remarkably so but i cannot tell why unless the absence of miss terry towards whom his conscience reproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent was a relief to him there were only twelve dances of which i danced nine and was merely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner we began at ten supped at one and were at deane before five there were but fifty people in the room very few families indeed from our side of the county and not many more from the other my partners were the two st johns hooper holder and a very prodigious mr mathew with whom i called the last and whom i liked the best of my little stock there were very few beauties and such as there were were not very handsome miss iremonger did not look well and mrs blount was the only one much admired she appeared exactly as she did in september with the same broad face diamond bandeau white shoes pink husband and fat neck the two miss coxes were there i traced in one the remains of the vulgar broadfeatured girl who danced at enham eight years ago the other is refined into a nice composedlooking girl like catherine bigg i looked at sir thomas champneys and thought of poor rosalie i looked at his daughter and thought her a queer animal with a white neck mrs warren i was constrained to think a very fine young woman which i much regret she danced away with great activity her husband is ugly enough uglier even than his cousin john but he does not look so very old the miss maitlands are both prettyish very like anne with brown skins large dark eyes and a good deal of nose the general has got the gout and mrs maitland the jaundice miss debary susan and sally all in black but without any statues made their appearance and i was as civil to them as circumstances would allow me mary said that i looked very well last night i wore my aunts gown and handkerchief and my hair was at least tidy which was all my ambition i will now have done with the ball and i will moreover go and dress for dinner farewell charles sends you his best love and edward his worst if you think the distinction improper you may take the worst yourself he will write to you when he gets back to his ship and in the mean time desires that you will consider me as your affectionate sister j a fridayi have determined to go on thursday but of course not before the post comes in charles is in very good looks indeed i had the comfort of finding out the other evening who all the fat girls with long noses were that disturbed me at the first h ball they all proved to be miss atkinsons of enillegible i rejoice to say that we have just had another letter from our dear frank it is to you very short written from larnica in cyprus and so lately as october he came from alexandria and was to return there in three or four days knew nothing of his promotion and does not write above twenty lines from a doubt of the letters ever reaching you and an idea of all letters being opened at vienna he wrote a few days before to you from alexandria by the mercury sent with despatches to lord keith another letter must be owing to us besides this one if not two because none of these are to me henry comes tomorrow for one night only my mother has heard from mrs e leigh lady saye and seale and her daughter are going to remove to bath mrs estwick is married again to a mr sloane a young man under age without the knowledge of either family he bears a good character however miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xviii steventon saturday january my dear cassandraas you have by this time received my last letter it is fit that i should begin another and i begin with the hope which is at present uppermost in my mind that you often wore a white gown in the morning at the time of all the gay parties being with you our visit at ash park last wednesday went off in a comecá way we met mr lefroy and tom chute played at cards and came home again james and mary dined here on the following day and at night henry set off in the mail for london he was as agreeable as ever during his visit and has not lost anything in miss lloyds estimation yesterday we were quite aloneonly our four selves but today the scene is agreeably varied by marys driving martha to basingstoke and marthas afterwards dining at deane my mother looks forward with as much certainty as you can do to our keeping two maids my father is the only one not in the secret we plan having a steady cook and a young giddy housemaid with a sedate middleaged man who is to undertake the double office of husband to the former and sweetheart to the latter no children of course to be allowed on either side you feel more for john bond than john bond deserves i am sorry to lower his character but he is not ashamed to own himself that he has no doubt at all of getting a good place and that he had even an offer many years ago from a farmer paine of taking him into his service whenever he might quit my fathers there are three parts of bath which we have thought of as likely to have houses in themwestgate buildings charles street and some of the short streets leading from laura place or pulteney street westgate buildings though quite in the lower part of the town are not badly situated themselves the street is broad and has rather a good appearance charles street however i think is preferable the buildings are new and its nearness to kingsmead fields would be a pleasant circumstance perhaps you may remember or perhaps you may forget that charles street leads from the queen square chapel to the two green park streets the houses in the streets near laura place i should expect to be above our price gay street would be too high except only the lower house on the lefthand side as you ascend towards that my mother has no disinclination it used to be lower rented than any other house in the row from some inferiority in the apartments but above all others her wishes are at present fixed on the corner house in chapel row which opens into princes street her knowledge of it however is confined only to the outside and therefore she is equally uncertain of its being really desirable as of its being to be had in the mean time she assures you that she will do everything in her power to avoid trim street although you have not expressed the fearful presentiment of it which was rather expected we know that mrs perrot will want to get us into oxford buildings but we all unite in particular dislike of that part of the town and therefore hope to escape upon all these different situations you and edward may confer together and your opinion of each will be expected with eagerness as to our pictures the battlepiece mr nibbs sir william east and all the old heterogeneous miscellany manuscript scriptural pieces dispersed over the house are to be given to james your own drawings will not cease to be your own and the two paintings on tin will be at your disposal my mother says that the french agricultural prints in the best bedroom were given by edward to his two sisters do you or he know anything about it she has written to my aunt and we are all impatient for the answer i do not know how to give up the idea of our both going to paragon in may your going i consider as indispensably necessary and i shall not like being left behind there is no place here or hereabouts that i shall want to be staying at and though to be sure the keep of two will be more than of one i will endeavor to make the difference less by disordering my stomach with bath buns and as to the trouble of accommodating us whether there are one or two it is much the same according to the first plan my mother and our two selves are to travel down together and my father follow us afterwards in about a fortnight or three weeks we have promised to spend a couple of days at ibthorp in our way we must all meet at bath you know before we set out for the sea and everything considered i think the first plan as good as any my father and mother wisely aware of the difficulty of finding in all bath such a bed as their own have resolved on taking it with them all the beds indeed that we shall want are to be removednamely besides theirs our own two the best for a spare one and two for servants and these necessary articles will probably be the only material ones that it would answer to send down i do not think it will be worth while to remove any of our chests of drawers we shall be able to get some of a much more commodious sort made of deal and painted to look very neat and i flatter myself that for little comforts of all kinds our apartment will be one of the most complete things of the sort all over bath bristol included we have thought at times of removing the sideboard or a pembroke table or some other piece of furniture but upon the whole it has ended in thinking that the trouble and risk of the removal would be more than the advantage of having them at a place where everything may be purchased pray send your opinion martha has as good as promised to come to us again in march her spirits are better than they were my mother bargains for having no trouble at all in furnishing our house in bath and i have engaged for your willingly undertaking to do it all i get more and more reconciled to the idea of our removal we have lived long enough in this neighborhood the basingstoke balls are certainly on the decline there is something interesting in the bustle of going away and the prospect of spending future summers by the sea or in wales is very delightful for a time we shall now possess many of the advantages which i have often thought of with envy in the wives of sailors or soldiers it must not be generally known however that i am not sacrificing a great deal in quitting the country or i can expect to inspire no tenderness no interest in those we leave behind yours affectionately j a miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xix steventon thursday january my dear cassandrathe perhaps which concluded my last letter being only a perhaps will not occasion your being overpowered with surprise i dare say if you should receive this before tuesday which unless circumstances are very perverse will be the case i received yours with much general philanthropy and still more peculiar goodwill two days ago and i suppose i need not tell you that it was very long being written on a foolscap sheet and very entertaining being written by you mr payne has been dead long enough for henry to be out of mourning for him before his last visit though we knew nothing of it till about that time why he died or of what complaint or to what noblemen he bequeathed his four daughters in marriage we have not heard i am glad that the wildmans are going to give a ball and hope you will not fail to benefit both yourself and me by laying out a few kisses in the purchase of a frank i believe you are right in proposing to delay the cambric muslin and i submit with a kind of voluntary reluctance mr peter debary has declined deane curacy he wishes to be settled near london a foolish reason as if deane were not near london in comparison of exeter or york take the whole world through and he will find many more places at a greater distance from london than deane than he will at a less what does he think of glencoe or lake katherine i feel rather indignant that any possible objection should be raised against so valuable a piece of preferment so delightful a situationthat deane should not be universally allowed to be as near the metropolis as any other country villages as this is the case however as mr peter debary has shown himself a peter in the blackest sense of the word we are obliged to look elsewhere for an heir and my father has thought it a necessary compliment to james digweed to offer the curacy to him though without considering it as either a desirable or an eligible situation for him unless he is in love with miss lyford i think he had better not be settled exactly in this neighborhood and unless he is very much in love with her indeed he is not likely to think a salary of l equal in value or efficiency to one of l were you indeed to be considered as one of the fixtures of the housebut you were never actually erected in it either by mr egerton brydges or mrs lloyd you are very kind in planning presents for me to make and my mother has shown me exactly the same attention but as i do not choose to have generosity dictated to me i shall not resolve on giving my cabinet to anna till the first thought of it has been my own sidmouth is now talked of as our summer abode get all the information therefore about it that you can from mrs c cage my fathers old ministers are already deserting him to pay their court to his son the brown mare which as well as the black was to devolve on james at our removal has not had patience to wait for that and has settled herself even now at deane the death of hugh capet which like that of mr skipsey though undesired was not wholly unexpected being purposely effected has made the immediate possession of the mare very convenient and everything else i suppose will be seized by degrees in the same manner martha and i work at the books every day yours affectionately j a miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xx steventon wednesday january poor miss austen it appears to me that i have rather oppressed you of late by the frequency of my letters you had hoped not to hear from me again before tuesday but sunday showed you with what a merciless sister you had to deal i cannot recall the past but you shall not hear from me quite so often in future your letter to mary was duly received before she left deane with martha yesterday morning and it gives us great pleasure to know that the chilham ball was so agreeable and that you danced four dances with mr kemble desirable however as the latter circumstance was i cannot help wondering at its taking place why did you dance four dances with so stupid a man why not rather dance two of them with some elegant brother officer who was struck with your appearance as soon as you entered the room martha left you her best love she will write to you herself in a short time but trusting to my memory rather than her own she has nevertheless desired me to ask you to purchase for her two bottles of steeles lavender water when you are in town provided you should go to the shop on your own account otherwise you may be sure that she would not have you recollect the request james dined with us yesterday wrote to edward in the evening filled three sides of paper every line inclining too much towards the northeast and the very first line of all scratched out and this morning he joins his lady in the fields of elysium and ibthorp last friday was a very busy day with us we were visited by miss lyford and mr bayle the latter began his operations in the house but had only time to finish the four sittingrooms the rest is deferred till the spring is more advanced and the days longer he took his paper of appraisement away with him and therefore we only know the estimate he has made of one or two articles of furniture which my father particularly inquired into i understand however that he was of opinion that the whole would amount to more than two hundred pounds and it is not imagined that this will comprehend the brewhouse and many other etc etc miss lyford was very pleasant and gave my mother such an account of the houses in westgate buildings where mrs lyford lodged four years ago as made her think of a situation there with great pleasure but your opposition will be without difficulty decisive and my father in particular who was very well inclined towards the row before has now ceased to think of it entirely at present the environs of laura place seem to be his choice his views on the subject are much advanced since i came home he grows quite ambitious and actually requires now a comfortable and a creditablelooking house on saturday miss lyford went to her long homethat is to say it was a long way offand soon afterwards a party of fine ladies issuing from a wellknown commodious green vehicle their heads full of bantam cocks and galinies entered the housemrs heathcote mrs harwood mrs james austen miss bigg miss jane blachford hardly a day passes in which we do not have some visitor or other yesterday came mrs bramstone who is very sorry that she is to lose us and afterwards mr holder who was shut up for an hour with my father and james in a most awful manner john bond est à lui xxi steventon wednesday january expect a most agreeable letter for not being overburdened with subject having nothing at all to say i shall have no check to my genius from beginning to end well and so pranks letter has made you very happy but you are afraid he would not have patience to stay for the haarlem which you wish him to have done as being safer than the merchantman poor fellow to wait from the middle of november to the end of december and perhaps even longer it must be sad work especially in a place where the ink is so abominably pale what a surprise to him it must have been on october to be visited collared and thrust out of the petterel by captain inglis he kindly passes over the poignancy of his feelings in quitting his ship his officers and his men what a pity it is that he should not be in england at the time of this promotion because he certainly would have had an appointment so everybody says and therefore it must be right for me to say it too had he been really here the certainty of the appointment i dare say would not have been half so great but as it could not be brought to the proof his absence will be always a lucky source of regret eliza talks of having read in a newspaper that all the first lieutenants of the frigates whose captains were to be sent into lineofbattle ships were to be promoted to the rank of commanders if it be true mr valentine may afford himself a fine valentines knot and charles may perhaps become first of the endymion though i suppose captain durham is too likely to bring a villain with him under that denomination the neighborhood have quite recovered the death of mrs riderso much so that i think they are rather rejoiced at it now her things were so very dear and mrs rogers is to be all that is desirable not even death itself can fix the friendship of the world the wylmots being robbed must be an amusing thing to their acquaintance and i hope it is as much their pleasure as it seems their avocation to be subjects of general entertainment i have a great mind not to acknowledge the receipt of your letter which i have just had the pleasure of reading because i am so ashamed to compare the sprawling lines of this with it but if i say all that i have to say i hope i have no reason to hang myself why did not j d make his proposals to you i suppose he went to see the cathedral that he might know how he should like to be married in it miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xxii southampton wednesday january my dear cassandrayou were mistaken in supposing i should expect your letter on sunday i had no idea of hearing from you before tuesday and my pleasure yesterday was therefore unhurt by any previous disappointment i thank you for writing so much you must really have sent me the value of two letters in one we are extremely glad to hear that elizabeth is so much better and hope you will be sensible of still further amendment in her when you return from canterbury of your visit there i must now speak incessantly it surprises but pleases me more and i consider it as a very just and honorable distinction of you and not less to the credit of mrs knight i have no doubt of your spending your time with her most pleasantly in quiet and rational conversation and am so far from thinking her expectations of you will be deceived that my only fear is of your being so agreeable so much to her taste as to make her wish to keep you with her forever if that should be the case we must remove to canterbury which i should not like so well as southampton when you receive this our guests will be all gone or going and i shall be left to the comfortable disposal of my time to ease of mind from the torments of rice puddings and apple dumplings and probably to regret that i did not take more pains to please them all mrs j austen has asked me to return with her to steventon i need not give my answer and she has invited my mother to spend there the time of mrs f as confinement which she seems half inclined to do a few days ago i had a letter from miss irvine and as i was in her debt you will guess it to be a remonstrance not a very severe one however the first page is in her usual retrospective jealous inconsistent style but the remainder is chatty and harmless she supposes my silence may have proceeded from resentment of her not having written to inquire particularly after my hoopingcough etc she is a funny one i have answered her letter and have endeavored to give something like the truth with as little incivility as i could by placing my silence to the want of subject in the very quiet way in which we live phebe has repented and stays i have also written to charles and i answered miss bullers letter by return of post as i intended to tell you in my last two or three things i recollected when it was too late that i might have told you one is that the welbys have lost their eldest son by a putrid fever at eton and another that tom chute is going to settle in norfolk you have scarcely ever mentioned lizzy since your being at godmersham i hope it is not because she is altered for the worse i cannot yet satisfy fanny as to mrs footes babys name and i must not encourage her to expect a good one as captain foote is a professed adversary to all but the plainest he likes only mary elizabeth anne etc our best chance is of caroline which in compliment to a sister seems the only exception he dined with us on friday and i fear will not soon venture again for the strength of our dinner was a boiled leg of mutton underdone even for james and captain foote has a particular dislike to underdone mutton but he was so goodhumored and pleasant that i did not much mind his being starved he gives us all the most cordial invitation to his house in the country saying just what the williams ought to say to make us welcome of them we have seen nothing since you left us and we hear that they are just gone to bath again to be out of the way of further alterations at brooklands mrs f a has had a very agreeable letter from mrs dickson who was delighted with the purse and desires her not to provide herself with a christening dress which is exactly what her young correspondent wanted and she means to defer making any of the caps as long as she can in hope of having mrs ds present in time to be serviceable as a pattern she desires me to tell you that the gowns were cut out before your letter arrived but that they are long enough for caroline the beds as i believe they are called have fallen to franks share to continue and of course are cut out to admiration alphonsine did not do we were disgusted in twenty pages as independent of a bad translation it has indelicacies which disgrace a pen hitherto so pure and we changed it for the female quixote which now makes our evening amusement to me a very high one as i find the work quite equal to what i remembered it mrs f a to whom it is new enjoys it as one could wish the other mary i believe has little pleasure from that or any other book my mother does not seem at all more disappointed than ourselves at the termination of the family treaty she thinks less of that just now than of the comfortable state of her own finances which she finds on closing her years accounts beyond her expectation as she begins the new year with a balance of l in her favor and when she has written her answer to my aunt which you know always hangs a little upon her mind she will be above the world entirely you will have a great deal of unreserved discourse with mrs k i dare say upon this subject as well as upon many other of our family matters abuse everybody but me thursdaywe expected james yesterday but he did not come if he comes at all now his visit will be a very short one as he must return tomorrow that ajax and the chair may be sent to winchester on saturday carolines new pelisse depended upon her mothers being able or not to come so far in the chair how the guinea that will be saved by the same means of return is to be spent i know not mrs j a does not talk much of poverty now though she has no hope of my brothers being able to buy another horse next summer their scheme against warwickshire continues but i doubt the familys being at stoneleigh so early as james says he must go which is may my mother is afraid i have not been explicit enough on the subject of her wealth she began with l she begins with l and this after l purchase of stock frank too has been settling his accounts and making calculations and each party feels quite equal to our present expenses but much increase of houserent would not do for either frank limits himself i believe to four hundred a year you will be surprised to hear that jenny is not yet come back we have heard nothing of her since her reaching itchingswell and can only suppose that she must be detained by illness in somebody or other and that she has been each day expecting to be able to come on the morrow i am glad i did not know beforehand that she was to be absent during the whole or almost the whole of our friends being with us for though the inconvenience has not been nothing i should have feared still more our dinners have certainly suffered not a little by having only mollys head and mollys hands to conduct them she fries better than she did but not like jenny we did not take our walk on friday it was too dirty nor have we yet done it we may perhaps do something like it today as after seeing frank skate which he hopes to do in the meadows by the beech we are to treat ourselves with a passage over the ferry it is one of the pleasantest frosts i ever knew so very quiet i hope it will last some time longer for franks sake who is quite anxious to get some skating he tried yesterday but it would not do our acquaintance increase too fast he was recognized lately by admiral bertie and a few days since arrived the admiral and his daughter catherine to wait upon us there was nothing to like or dislike in either to the berties are to be added the lances with whose cards we have been endowed and whose visit frank and i returned yesterday they live about a mile and threequarters from s to the right of the new road to portsmouth and i believe their house is one of those which are to be seen almost anywhere among the woods on the other side of the itchen it is a handsome building stands high and in a very beautiful situation we found only mrs lance at home and whether she boasts any offspring besides a grand pianoforte did not appear she was civil and chatty enough and offered to introduce us to some acquaintance in southampton which we gratefully declined i suppose they must be acting by the orders of mr lance of netherton in this civility as there seems no other reason for their coming near us they will not come often i dare say they live in a handsome style and are rich and she seemed to like to be rich and we gave her to understand that we were far from being so she will soon feel therefore that we are not worth her acquaintance you must have heard from martha by this time we have had no accounts of kintbury since her letter to me mrs f a has had one fainting fit lately it came on as usual after eating a hearty dinner but did not last long i can recollect nothing more to say when my letter is gone i suppose i shall yours affectionately j a i have just asked caroline if i should send her love to her godmamma to which she answered yes miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xxiii southampton february our garden is putting in order by a man who bears a remarkably good character has a very fine complexion and asks something less than the first the shrubs which border the gravel walk he says are only sweetbrier and roses and the latter of an indifferent sort we mean to get a few of a better kind therefore and at my own particular desire he procures us some syringas i could not do without a syringa for the sake of cowpers line we talk also of a laburnum the border under the terrace wall is clearing away to receive currants and gooseberry bushes and a spot is found very proper for raspberries the alterations and improvements within doors too advance very properly and the offices will be made very convenient indeed our dressingtable is constructing on the spot out of a large kitchen table belonging to the house for doing which we have the permission of mr husket lord lansdowns painterdomestic painter i should call him for he lives in the castle domestic chaplains have given way to this more necessary office and i suppose whenever the walls want no touching up he is employed about my ladys face the morning was so wet that i was afraid we should not be able to see our little visitor but frank who alone could go to church called for her after service and she is now talking away at my side and examining the treasures of my writingdesk drawersvery happy i believe not at all shy of course her name is catherine and her sisters caroline she is something like her brother and as short for her age but not so welllooking what is become of all the shyness in the world moral as well as natural diseases disappear in the progress of time and new ones take their place shyness and the sweating sickness have given way to confidence and paralytic complaints eveningour little visitor has just left us and left us highly pleased with her she is a nice natural openhearted affectionate girl with all the ready civility which one sees in the best children in the present day so unlike anything that i was myself at her age that i am often all astonishment and shame half her time was spent at spillikins which i consider as a very valuable part of our household furniture and as not the least important benefaction from the family of knight to that of austen but i must tell you a story mary has for some time had notice from mrs dickson of the intended arrival of a certain miss fowler in this place miss f is an intimate friend of mrs d and a good deal known as such to mary on thursday last she called here while we were out mary found on our return her card with only her name on it and she had left word that she would call again the particularity of this made us talk and among other conjectures frank said in joke i dare say she is staying with the pearsons the connection of the names struck mary and she immediately recollected miss fowlers having been very intimate with persons so called and upon putting everything together we have scarcely a doubt of her being actually staying with the only family in the place whom we cannot visit what a contretemps in the language of france what an unluckiness in that of madame duval the black gentleman has certainly employed one of his menial imps to bring about this complete though trifling mischief miss f has never called again but we are in daily expectation of it miss p has of course given her a proper understanding of the business it is evident that miss f did not expect or wish to have the visit returned and frank is quite as much on his guard for his wife as we could desire for her sake or our own we shall rejoice in being so near winchester when edward belongs to it and can never have our spare bed filled more to our satisfaction than by him does he leave eltham at easter we are reading clarentine and are surprised to find how foolish it is i remember liking it much less on a second reading than at the first and it does not bear a third at all it is full of unnatural conduct and forced difficulties without striking merit of any kind miss harrison is going into devonshire to attend mrs dusantoy as usual miss j is married to young mr g and is to be very unhappy he swears drinks is cross jealous selfish and brutal the match makes her family miserable and has occasioned his being disinherited the browns are added to our list of acquaintance he commands the sea fencibles here under sir thomas and was introduced at his own desire by the latter when we saw him last week as yet the gentlemen only have visited as mrs b is ill but she is a nicelooking woman and wears one of the prettiest straw bonnets in the place mondaythe garret beds are made and ours will be finished today i had hoped it would be finished on saturday but neither mrs hall nor jenny was able to give help enough for that and i have as yet done very little and mary nothing at all this week we shall do more and i should like to have all the five beds completed by the end of it there will then be the windowcurtains sofacover and a carpet to be altered i should not be surprised if we were to be visited by james again this week he gave us reason to expect him soon and if they go to eversley he cannot come next week there i flatter myself i have constructed you a smartish letter considering my want of materials but like my dear dr johnson i believe i have dealt more in notions than facts i hope your cough is gone and that you are otherwise well and remain with love yours affectionately j a miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xxiv godmersham wednesday june my dear cassandrawhere shall i begin which of all my important nothings shall i tell you first at half after seven yesterday morning henry saw us into our own carriage and we drove away from the bath hotel which by the by had been found most uncomfortable quartersvery dirty very noisy and very illprovided james began his journey by the coach at five our first eight miles were hot deptford hill brought to my mind our hot journey into kent fourteen years ago but after blackheath we suffered nothing and as the day advanced it grew quite cool at dartford which we reached within the two hours and threequarters we went to the bull the same inn at which we breakfasted in that said journey and on the present occasion had about the same bad butter at halfpast ten we were again off and travelling on without any adventure reached sittingbourne by three daniel was watching for us at the door of the george and i was acknowledged very kindly by mr and mrs marshall to the latter of whom i devoted my conversation while mary went out to buy some gloves a few minutes of course did for sittingbourne and so off we drove drove drove and by six oclock were at godmersham our two brothers were walking before the house as we approached as natural as life fanny and lizzy met us in the hall with a great deal of pleasant joy we went for a few minutes into the breakfastparlor and then proceeded to our rooms mary has the hall chamber i am in the yellow roomvery literallyfor i am writing in it at this moment it seems odd to me to have such a great place all to myself and to be at godmersham without you is also odd you are wished for i assure you fanny who came to me as soon as she had seen her aunt james to her room and stayed while i dressed was as energetic as usual in her longings for you she is grown both in height and size since last year but not immoderately looks very well and seems as to conduct and manner just what she was and what one could wish her to continue elizabeth who was dressing when we arrived came to me for a minute attended by marianne charles and louisa and you will not doubt gave me a very affectionate welcome that i had received such from edward also i need not mention but i do you see because it is a pleasure i never saw him look in better health and fanny says he is perfectly well i cannot praise elizabeths looks but they are probably affected by a cold her little namesake has gained in beauty in the last three years though not all that marianne has lost charles is not quite so lovely as he was louisa is much as i expected and cassandra i find handsomer than i expected though at present disguised by such a violent breakingout that she does not come down after dinner she has charming eyes and a nice open countenance and seems likely to be very lovable her size is magnificent i was agreeably surprised to find louisa bridges still here she looks remarkably well legacies are very wholesome diet and is just what she always was john is at sandling you may fancy our dinnerparty therefore fanny of course belonging to it and little edward for that day he was almost too happy his happiness at least made him too talkative it has struck ten i must go to breakfast since breakfast i have had a têteàtête with edward in his room he wanted to know jamess plans and mine and from what his own now are i think it already nearly certain that i shall return when they do though not with them edward will be going about the same time to alton where he has business with mr trimmer and where he means his son should join him and i shall probably be his companion to that place and get on afterwards somehow or other i should have preferred a rather longer stay here certainly but there is no prospect of any later conveyance for me as he does not mean to accompany edward on his return to winchester from a very natural unwillingness to leave elizabeth at that time i shall at any rate be glad not to be obliged to be an incumbrance on those who have brought me here for as james has no horse i must feel in their carriage that i am taking his place we were rather crowded yesterday though it does not become me to say so as i and my boa were of the party and it is not to be supposed but that a child of three years of age was fidgety i need scarcely beg you to keep all this to yourself lest it should get round by annas means she is very kindly inquired after by her friends here who all regret her not coming with her father and mother i left henry i hope free from his tiresome complaint in other respects well and thinking with great pleasure of cheltenham and stoneleigh the brewery scheme is quite at an end at a meeting of the subscribers last week it was by general and i believe very hearty consent dissolved the country is very beautiful i saw as much as ever to admire in my yesterdays journey footnote mrs edward austen xxv castle square october my dearest cassandrai have received your letter and with most melancholy anxiety was it expected for the sad news reached us last night but without any particulars it came in a short letter to martha from her sister begun at steventon and finished in winchester we have felt we do feel for you all as you will not need to be toldfor you for fanny for henry for lady bridges and for dearest edward whose loss and whose sufferings seem to make those of every other person nothing god be praised that you can say what you do of him that he has a religious mind to bear him up and a disposition that will gradually lead him to comfort my dear dear fanny i am so thankful that she has you with her you will be everything to her you will give her all the consolation that human aid can give may the almighty sustain you all and keep you my dearest cassandra well but for the present i dare say you are equal to everything you will know that the poor boys are at steventon perhaps it is best for them as they will have more means of exercise and amusement there than they could have with us but i own myself disappointed by the arrangement i should have loved to have them with me at such a time i shall write to edward by this post we shall of course hear from you again very soon and as often as you can write we will write as you desire and i shall add bookham hamstall i suppose you write to yourselves as you do not mention it what a comfort that mrs deedes is saved from present misery and alarm but it will fall heavy upon poor harriot and as for lady b but that her fortitude does seem truly great i should fear the effect of such a blow and so unlooked for i long to hear more of you all of henrys anguish i think with grief and solicitude but he will exert himself to be of use and comfort with what true sympathy our feelings are shared by martha you need not be told she is the friend and sister under every circumstance we need not enter into a panegyric on the departed but it is sweet to think of her great worth of her solid principles of her true devotion her excellence in every relation of life it is also consolatory to reflect on the shortness of the sufferings which led her from this world to a better farewell for the present my dearest sister tell edward that we feel for him and pray for him yours affectionately j austen i will write to catherine perhaps you can give me some directions about mourning miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent footnote the death of mrs edward austen xxvi castle square saturday night october my dear cassandrayour accounts make us as comfortable as we can expect to be at such a time edwards loss is terrible and must be felt as such and these are too early days indeed to think of moderation in grief either in him or his afflicted daughter but soon we may hope that our dear fannys sense of duty to that beloved father will rouse her to exertion for his sake and as the most acceptable proof of love to the spirit of her departed mother she will try to be tranquil and resigned does she feel you to be a comfort to her or is she too much overpowered for anything but solitude your account of lizzy is very interesting poor child one must hope the impression will be strong and yet ones heart aches for a dejected mind of eight years old i suppose you see the corpse how does it appear we are anxious to be assured that edward will not attend the funeral but when it comes to the point i think he must feel it impossible your parcel shall set off on monday and i hope the shoes will fit martha and i both tried them on i shall send you such of your mourning as i think most likely to be useful reserving for myself your stockings and half the velvet in which selfish arrangement i know i am doing what you wish i am to be in bombazeen and crape according to what we are told is universal here and which agrees with marthas previous observation my mourning however will not impoverish me for by having my velvet pelisse fresh lined and made up i am sure i shall have no occasion this winter for anything new of that sort i take my cloak for the lining and shall send yours on the chance of its doing something of the same for you though i believe your pelisse is in better repair than mine one miss baker makes my gown and the other my bonnet which is to be silk covered with crape i have written to edward cooper and hope he will not send one of his letters of cruel comfort to my poor brother and yesterday i wrote to alethea bigg in reply to a letter from her she tells us in confidence that catherine is to be married on tuesday sennight mr hill is expected at manydown in the course of the ensuing week we are desired by mrs harrison and miss austen to say everything proper for them to yourself and edward on this sad occasion especially that nothing but a wish of not giving additional trouble where so much is inevitable prevents their writing themselves to express their concern they seem truly to feel concern i am glad you can say what you do of mrs knight and of goodnestone in general it is a great relief to me to know that the shock did not make any of them ill but what a task was yours to announce it now i hope you are not overpowered with letterwriting as henry and john can ease you of many of your correspondents was mr scudamore in the house at the time was any application attempted and is the seizure at all accounted for sundayas edwards letter to his son is not come here we know that you must have been informed as early as friday of the boys being at steventon which i am glad of upon your letter to dr goddards being forwarded to them mary wrote to ask whether my mother wished to have her grandsons sent to her we decided on their remaining where they were which i hope my brother will approve of i am sure he will do us the justice of believing that in such a decision we sacrificed inclination to what we thought best i shall write by the coach tomorrow to mrs j a and to edward about their mourning though this days post will probably bring directions to them on that subject from yourselves i shall certainly make use of the opportunity of addressing our nephew on the most serious of all concerns as i naturally did in my letter to him before the poor boys are perhaps more comfortable at steventon than they could be here but you will understand my feelings with respect to it tomorrow will be a dreadful day for you all mr whitfields will be a severe duty glad shall i be to hear that it is over that you are forever in our thoughts you will not doubt i see your mournful party in my minds eye under every varying circumstance of the day and in the evening especially figure to myself its sad gloom the efforts to talk the frequent summons to melancholy orders and cares and poor edward restless in misery going from one room to another and perhaps not seldom upstairs to see all that remains of his elizabeth dearest fanny must now look upon herself as his prime source of comfort his dearest friend as the being who is gradually to supply to him to the extent that is possible what he has lost this consideration will elevate and cheer her adieu you cannot write too often as i said before we are heartily rejoiced that the poor baby gives you no particular anxiety kiss dear lizzy for us tell fanny that i shall write in a day or two to miss sharpe my mother is not ill yours most truly j austen tell henry that a hamper of apples is gone to him from kintbury and that mr fowle intended writing on friday supposing him in london to beg that the charts etc may be consigned to the care of the palmers mrs fowle has also written to miss palmer to beg she will send for them miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent footnote mr whitfield was the rector of godmersham at this time having come there in xxvii castle square monday october my dear cassandraedward and george came to us soon after seven on saturday very well but very cold having by choice travelled on the outside and with no greatcoat but what mr wise the coachman goodnaturedly spared them of his as they sat by his side they were so much chilled when they arrived that i was afraid they must have taken cold but it does not seem at all the case i never saw them looking better they behave extremely well in every respect showing quite as much feeling as one wishes to see and on every occasion speaking of their father with the liveliest affection his letter was read over by each of them yesterday and with many tears george sobbed aloud edwards tears do not flow so easily but as far as i can judge they are both very properly impressed by what has happened miss lloyd who is a more impartial judge than i can be is exceedingly pleased with them george is almost a new acquaintance to me and i find him in a different way as engaging as edward we do not want amusement bilbocatch at which george is indefatigable spillikins paper ships riddles conundrums and cards with watching the flow and ebb of the river and now and then a stroll out keep us well employed and we mean to avail ourselves of our kind papas consideration by not returning to winchester till quite the evening of wednesday mrs j a had not time to get them more than one suit of clothes their others are making here and though i do not believe southampton is famous for tailoring i hope it will prove itself better than basingstoke edward has an old black coat which will save his having a second new one but i find that black pantaloons are considered by them as necessary and of course one would not have them made uncomfortable by the want of what is usual on such occasions fannys letter was received with great pleasure yesterday and her brother sends his thanks and will answer it soon we all saw what she wrote and were very much pleased with it tomorrow i hope to hear from you and tomorrow we must think of poor catherine today lady bridges is the heroine of our thoughts and glad shall we be when we can fancy the meeting over there will then be nothing so very bad for edward to undergo the st albans i find sailed on the very day of my letters reaching yarmouth so that we must not expect an answer at present we scarcely feel however to be in suspense or only enough to keep our plans to ourselves we have been obliged to explain them to our young visitors in consequence of fannys letter but we have not yet mentioned them to steventon we are all quite familiarized to the idea ourselves my mother only wants mrs seward to go out at midsummer what sort of a kitchen garden is there mrs j a expresses her fear of our settling in kent and till this proposal was made we began to look forward to it here my mother was actually talking of a house at wye it will be best however as it is anne has just given her mistress warning she is going to be married i wish she would stay her year on the subject of matrimony i must notice a wedding in the salisbury paper which has amused me very much dr phillot to lady frances st lawrence she wanted to have a husband i suppose once in her life and he a lady frances i hope your sorrowing party were at church yesterday and have no longer that to dread martha was kept at home by a cold but i went with my two nephews and i saw edward was much affected by the sermon which indeed i could have supposed purposely addressed to the afflicted if the text had not naturally come in the course of dr mants observations on the litany all that are in danger necessity or tribulation was the subject of it the weather did not allow us afterwards to get farther than the quay where george was very happy as long as we could stay flying about from one side to the other and skipping on board a collier immediately in the evening we had the psalms and lessons and a sermon at home to which they were very attentive but you will not expect to hear that they did not return to conundrums the moment it was over their aunt has written pleasantly of them which was more than i hoped while i write now george is most industriously making and naming paper ships at which he afterwards shoots with horsechestnuts brought from steventon on purpose and edward equally intent over the lake of killarney twisting himself about in one of our great chairs tuesdayyour closewritten letter makes me quite ashamed of my wide lines you have sent me a great deal of matter most of it very welcome as to your lengthened stay it is no more than i expected and what must be but you cannot suppose i like it all that you say of edward is truly comfortable i began to fear that when the bustle of the first week was over his spirits might for a time be more depressed and perhaps one must still expect something of the kind if you escape a bilious attack i shall wonder almost as much as rejoice i am glad you mentioned where catherine goes today it is a good plan but sensible people may generally be trusted to form such the day began cheerfully but it is not likely to continue what it should for them or for us we had a little waterparty yesterday i and my two nephews went from the itchen ferry up to northam where we landed looked into the and walked home and it was so much enjoyed that i had intended to take them to netley today the tide is just right for our going immediately after moonshine but i am afraid there will be rain if we cannot get so far however we may perhaps go round from the ferry to the quay i had not proposed doing more than cross the itchen yesterday but it proved so pleasant and so much to the satisfaction of all that when we reached the middle of the stream we agreed to be rowed up the river both the boys rowed great part of the way and their questions and remarks as well as their enjoyment were very amusing georges inquiries were endless and his eagerness in everything reminds me often of his uncle henry our evening was equally agreeable in its way i introduced speculation and it was so much approved that we hardly knew how to leave off your idea of an early dinner tomorrow is exactly what we propose for after writing the first part of this letter it came into my head that at this time of year we have not summer evenings we shall watch the light today that we may not give them a dark drive tomorrow they send their best love to papa and everybody with georges thanks for the letter brought by this post martha begs my brother may be assured of her interest in everything relating to him and his family and of her sincerely partaking our pleasure in the receipt of every good account from godmersham of chawton i think i can have nothing more to say but that everything you say about it in the letter now before me will i am sure as soon as i am able to read it to her make my mother consider the plan with more and more pleasure we had formed the same views on h digweeds farm a very kind and feeling letter is arrived today from kintbury mrs fowles sympathy and solicitude on such an occasion you will be able to do justice to and to express it as she wishes to my brother concerning you she says cassandra will i know excuse my writing to her it is not to save myself but her that i omit so doing give my best my kindest love to her and tell her i feel for her as i know she would for me on the same occasion and that i most sincerely hope her health will not suffer we have just had two hampers of apples from kintbury and the floor of our little garret is almost covered love to all yours very affectionately j a miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent xxviii castle square sunday november your letter my dear cassandra obliges me to write immediately that you may have the earliest notice of franks intending if possible to go to godmersham exactly at the time now fixed for your visit to goodnestone he resolved almost directly on the receipt of your former letter to try for an extension of his leave of absence that he might be able to go down to you for two days but charged me not to give you any notice of it on account of the uncertainty of success now however i must give it and now perhaps he may be giving it himself for i am just in the hateful predicament of being obliged to write what i know will somehow or other be of no use he meant to ask for five days more and if they were granted to go down by thursday nights mail and spend friday and saturday with you and he considered his chance of succeeding by no means bad i hope it will take place as he planned and that your arrangements with goodnestone may admit of suitable alteration your news of edward bridges was quite news for i have had no letter from wrotham i wish him happy with all my heart and hope his choice may turn out according to his own expectations and beyond those of his family and i dare say it will marriage is a great improver and in a similar situation harriet may be as amiable as eleanor as to money that will come you may be sure because they cannot do without it when you see him again pray give him our congratulations and best wishes this match will certainly set john and lucy going there are six bedchambers at chawton henry wrote to my mother the other day and luckily mentioned the number which is just what we wanted to be assured of he speaks also of garrets for storeplaces one of which she immediately planned fitting up for edwards manservant and now perhaps it must be for our own for she is already quite reconciled to our keeping one the difficulty of doing without one had been thought of before his name shall be robert if you please before i can tell you of it you will have heard that miss sawbridge is married it took place i believe on thursday mrs fowle has for some time been in the secret but the neighborhood in general were quite unsuspicious mr maxwell was tutor to the young gregorysconsequently they must be one of the happiest couples in the world and either of them worthy of envy for she must be excessively in love and he mounts from nothing to a comfortable home martha has heard him very highly spoken of they continue for the present at speen hill i have a southampton match to return for your kentish one captain g heathcote and miss a lyell i have it from alethea and like it because i had made it before yes the stoneleigh business is concluded but it was not till yesterday that my mother was regularly informed of it though the news had reached us on monday evening by way of steventon my aunt says as little as may be on the subject by way of information and nothing at all by way of satisfaction she reflects on mr t leighs dilatoriness and looks about with great diligence and success for inconvenience and evil among which she ingeniously places the danger of her new housemaids catching cold on the outside of the coach when she goes down to bath for a carriage makes her sick john binns has been offered their place but declines it as she supposes because he will not wear a livery whatever be the cause i like the effect in spite of all my mothers long and intimate knowledge of the writer she was not up to the expectation of such a letter as this the discontentedness of it shocked and surprised herbut i see nothing in it out of nature though a sad nature she does not forget to wish for chambers you may be sure no particulars are given not a word of arrears mentioned though in her letter to james they were in a general way spoken of the amount of them is a matter of conjecture and to my mother a most interesting one she cannot fix any time for their beginning with any satisfaction to herself but mrs leighs death and henrys two thousand pounds neither agrees with that period nor any other i did not like to own our previous information of what was intended last july and have therefore only said that if we could see henry we might hear many particulars as i had understood that some confidential conversation had passed between him and mr t l at stoneleigh we have been as quiet as usual since frank and mary left us mr criswick called on martha that very morning on his way home again from portsmouth and we have had no visitor since we called on the miss lyells one day and heard a good account of mr heathcotes canvass the success of which of course exceeds his expectations alethea in her letter hopes for my interest which i conclude means edwards and i take this opportunity therefore of requesting that he will bring in mr heathcote mr lane told us yesterday that mr h had behaved very handsomely and waited on mr thistlethwaite to say that if he mr t would stand he mr h would not oppose him but mr t declined it acknowledging himself still smarting under the payment of late electioneering costs the mrs hulberts we learn from kintbury come to steventon this week and bring mary jane fowle with them on her way to mrs nunes she returns at christmas with her brother our brother we may perhaps see in the course of a few days and we mean to take the opportunity of his help to go one night to the play martha ought to see the inside of the theatre once while she lives in southampton and i think she will hardly wish to take a second view the furniture of bellevue is to be sold tomorrow and we shall take it in our usual walk if the weather be favorable how could you have a wet day on thursday with us it was a prince of days the most delightful we have had for weeks soft bright with a brisk wind from the southwest everybody was out and talking of spring and martha and i did not know how to turn back on friday evening we had some very blowing weatherfrom six to nine i think we never heard it worse even here and one night we had so much rain that it forced its way again into the storecloset and though the evil was comparatively slight and the mischief nothing i had some employment the next day in drying parcels etc i have now moved still more out of the way martha sends her best love and thanks you for admitting her to the knowledge of the pros and cons about harriet foote she has an interest in all such matters i am also to say that she wants to see you mary jane missed her papa and mamma a good deal at first but now does very well without them i am glad to hear of little johns being better and hope your accounts of mrs knight will also improve adieu remember me affectionately to everybody and believe me ever yours j a miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent xxix castle square friday december many thanks my dear cassandra to you and mr deedes for your joint and agreeable composition which took me by surprise this morning he has certainly great merit as a writer he does ample justice to his subject and without being diffuse is clear and correct and though i do not mean to compare his epistolary powers with yours or to give him the same portion of my gratitude he certainly has a very pleasing way of winding up a whole and speeding truth into the world but all this as my dear mrs piozzi says is flight and fancy and nonsense for my master has his great casks to mind and i have my little children it is you however in this instance that have the little children and i that have the great cask for we are brewing spruce beer again but my meaning really is that i am extremely foolish in writing all this unnecessary stuff when i have so many matters to write about that my paper will hardly hold it all little matters they are to be sure but highly important in the first place miss curling is actually at portsmouth which i was always in hopes would not happen i wish her no worse however than a long and happy abode there here she would probably be dull and i am sure she would be troublesome the bracelets are in my possession and everything i could wish them to be they came with marthas pelisse which likewise gives great satisfaction soon after i had closed my last letter to you we were visited by mrs dickens and her sisterinlaw mrs bertie the wife of a lately made admiral mrs f a i believe was their first object but they put up with us very kindly and mrs d finding in miss lloyd a friend of mrs dundas had another motive for the acquaintance she seems a really agreeable womanthat is her manners are gentle and she knows a great many of our connections in west kent mrs bertie lives in the polygon and was out when we returned her visit which are her two virtues a larger circle of acquaintance and an increase of amusement is quite in character with our approaching removal yes i mean to go to as many balls as possible that i may have a good bargain everybody is very much concerned at our going away and everybody is acquainted with chawton and speaks of it as a remarkably pretty village and everybody knows the house we describe but nobody fixes on the right i am very much obliged to mrs knight for such a proof of the interest she takes in me and she may depend upon it that i will marry mr papillon whatever may be his reluctance or my own i owe her much more than such a trifling sacrifice our ball was rather more amusing than i expected martha liked it very much and i did not gape till the last quarter of an hour it was past nine before we were sent for and not twelve when we returned the room was tolerably full and there were perhaps thirty couple of dancers the melancholy part was to see so many dozen young women standing by without partners and each of them with two ugly naked shoulders it was the same room in which we danced fifteen years ago i thought it all over and in spite of the shame of being so much older felt with thankfulness that i was quite as happy now as then we paid an additional shilling for our tea which we took as we chose in an adjoining and very comfortable room there were only four dances and it went to my heart that the miss lances one of them too named emma should have partners only for two you will not expect to hear that i was asked to dance but i wasby the gentleman whom we met that sunday with captain dauvergne we have always kept up a bowing acquaintance since and being pleased with his black eyes i spoke to him at the ball which brought on me this civility but i do not know his name and he seems so little at home in the english language that i believe his black eyes may be the best of him captain dauvergne has got a ship martha and i made use of the very favorable state of yesterday for walking to pay our duty at chiswell we found mrs lance at home and alone and sat out three other ladies who soon came in we went by the ferry and returned by the bridge and were scarcely at all fatigued edward must have enjoyed the last two days you i presume had a cool drive to canterbury kitty foote came on wednesday and her evening visit began early enough for the last part the applepie of our dinner for we never dine now till five yesterday ior rather youhad a letter from nanny hilliard the object of which is that she would be very much obliged to us if we would get hannah a place i am sorry that i cannot assist her if you can let me know as i shall not answer the letter immediately mr sloper is married again not much to nannys or anybodys satisfaction the lady was governess to sir roberts natural children and seems to have nothing to recommend her i do not find however that nanny is likely to lose her place in consequence she says not a word of what service she wishes for hannah or what hannah can do but a nursery i suppose or something of that kind must be the thing having now cleared away my smaller articles of news i come to a communication of some weight no less than that my uncle and aunt are going to allow james l a year we hear of it through steventon mary sent us the other day an extract from my aunts letter on the subject in which the donation is made with the greatest kindness and intended as a compensation for his loss in the conscientious refusal of hampstead living l a year being all that he had at the time called its worth as i find it was always intended at steventon to divide the real income with kintbury nothing can be more affectionate than my aunts language in making the present and likewise in expressing her hope of their being much more together in future than to her great regret they have of late years been my expectations for my mother do not rise with this event we will allow a little more time however before we fly out if not prevented by parish business james comes to us on monday the mrs hulberts and miss murden are their guests at present and likely to continue such till christmas anna comes home on the th the hundred a year begins next ladyday i am glad you are to have henry with you again with him and the boys you cannot but have a cheerful and at times even a merry christmas martha is so mss torn we want to be settled at chawton in time for henry to come to us for some shooting in october at least or a little earlier and edward may visit us after taking his boys back to winchester suppose we name the th of september will not that do i have but one thing more to tell you mrs hill called on my mother yesterday while we were gone to chiswell and in the course of the visit asked her whether she knew anything of a clergymans family of the name of alford who had resided in our part of hampshire mrs hill had been applied to as likely to give some information of them on account of their probable vicinity to dr hills living by a lady or for a lady who had known mrs and the two miss alfords in bath whither they had removed it seems from hampshire and who now wishes to convey to the miss alfords some work or trimming which she has been doing for them but the mother and daughters have left bath and the lady cannot learn where they are gone to while my mother gave us the account the probability of its being ourselves occurred to us and it had previously struck herself what makes it more likely and even indispensably to be us is that she mentioned mr hammond as now having the living or curacy which the father had had i cannot think who our kind lady can be but i dare say we shall not like the work distribute the affectionate love of a heart not so tired as the right hand belonging to it yours ever sincerely j a miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent footnotes frank austen mr and mrs leigh perrot xxx castle square tuesday december my dear cassandrai can now write at leisure and make the most of my subjects which is lucky as they are not numerous this week our house was cleared by halfpast eleven on saturday and we had the satisfaction of hearing yesterday that the party reached home in safety soon after five i was very glad of your letter this morning for my mother taking medicine eliza keeping her bed with a cold and choles not coming made us rather dull and dependent on the post you tell me much that gives me pleasure but i think not much to answer i wish i could help you in your needlework i have two hands and a new thimble that lead a very easy life lady sondes match surprises but does not offend me had her first marriage been of affection or had there been a grownup single daughter i should not have forgiven her but i consider everybody as having a right to marry once in their lives for love if they can and provided she will now leave off having bad headaches and being pathetic i can allow her i can wish her to be happy do not imagine that your picture of your têteàtête with sir b makes any change in our expectations here he could not be really reading though he held the newspaper in his hand he was making up his mind to the deed and the manner of it i think you will have a letter from him soon i heard from portsmouth yesterday and as i am to send them more clothes they cannot be expecting a very early return to us marys face is pretty well but she must have suffered a great deal with it an abscess was formed and opened our evening party on thursday produced nothing more remarkable than miss murdens coming too though she had declined it absolutely in the morning and sitting very ungracious and very silent with us from seven oclock till half after eleven for so late was it owing to the chairmen before we got rid of them the last hour spent in yawning and shivering in a wide circle round the fire was dull enough but the tray had admirable success the widgeon and the preserved ginger were as delicious as one could wish but as to our black butter do not decoy anybody to southampton by such a lure for it is all gone the first pot was opened when frank and mary were here and proved not at all what it ought to be it was neither solid nor entirely sweet and on seeing it eliza remembered that miss austen had said she did not think it had been boiled enough it was made you know when we were absent such being the event of the first pot i would not save the second and we therefore ate it in unpretending privacy and though not what it ought to be part of it was very good james means to keep three horses on this increase of income at present he has but one mary wishes the other two to be fit to carry women and in the purchase of one edward will probably be called upon to fulfil his promise to his godson we have now pretty well ascertained jamess income to be eleven hundred pounds curate paid which makes us very happythe ascertainment as well as the income mary does not talk of the garden it may well be a disagreeable subject to her but her husband is persuaded that nothing is wanting to make the first new one good but trenching which is to be done by his own servants and john bond by degrees not at the expense which trenching the other amounted to i was happy to hear chiefly for annas sake that a ball at manydown was once more in agitation it is called a childs ball and given by mrs heathcote to wm such was its beginning at least but it will probably swell into something more edward was invited during his stay at manydown and it is to take place between this and twelfthday mrs hulbert has taken anna a pair of white shoes on the occasion i forgot in my last to tell you that we hear by way of kintbury and the palmers that they were all well at bermuda in the beginning of nov wednesdayyesterday must have been a day of sad remembrance at gm i am glad it is over we spent friday evening with our friends at the boardinghouse and our curiosity was gratified by the sight of their fellowinmates mrs drew and miss hook mr wynne and mr fitzhugh the latter is brother to mrs lance and very much the gentleman he has lived in that house more than twenty years and poor man is so totally deaf that they say he could not hear a cannon were it fired close to him having no cannon at hand to make the experiment i took it for granted and talked to him a little with my fingers which was funny enough i recommended him to read corinna miss hook is a wellbehaved genteelish woman mrs drew well behaved without being at all genteel mr wynne seems a chatty and rather familiar young man miss murden was quite a different creature this last evening from what she had been before owing to her having with marthas help found a situation in the morning which bids very fair for comfort when she leaves steventon she comes to board and lodge with mrs hookey the chemistfor there is no mr hookey i cannot say that i am in any hurry for the conclusion of her present visit but i was truly glad to see her comfortable in mind and spirits at her age perhaps one may be as friendless oneself and in similar circumstances quite as captious my mother has been lately adding to her possessions in platea whole tablespoon and a whole dessertspoon and six whole teaspoonswhich makes our sideboard border on the magnificent they were mostly the produce of old or useless silver i have turned the s in the list into s and the card looks all the better a silver tealadle is also added which will at least answer the purpose of making us sometimes think of john warren i have laid lady sondes case before martha who does not make the least objection to it and is particularly pleased with the name of montresor i do not agree with her there but i like his rank very much and always affix the ideas of strong sense and highly elegant manners to a general i must write to charles next week you may guess in what extravagant terms of praise earle harwood speaks of him he is looked up to by everybody in all america i shall not tell you anything more of wm digweeds china as your silence on the subject makes you unworthy of it mrs h digweed looks forward with great satisfaction to our being her neighbors i would have her enjoy the idea to the utmost as i suspect there will not be much in the reality with equal pleasure we anticipate an intimacy with her husbands bailiff and his wife who live close by us and are said to be remarkably good sort of people yes yes we will have a pianoforte as good a one as can be got for thirty guineas and i will practise country dances that we may have some amusement for our nephews and nieces when we have the pleasure of their company martha sends her love to henry and tells him that he will soon have a bill of miss chaplins about l to pay on her account but the bill shall not be sent in till his return to town i hope he comes to you in good health and in spirits as good as a first return to godmersham can allow with his nephews he will force himself to be cheerful till he really is so send me some intelligence of eliza it is a long while since i have heard of her we have had snow on the ground here almost a week it is now going but southampton must boast no longer we all send our love to edward junior and his brothers and i hope speculation is generally liked fare you well yours affectionately j austen my mother has not been out of doors this week but she keeps pretty well we have received through bookham an indifferent account of your godmother miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent footnote godmersham edward austens place xxxi castle square tuesday january i am not surprised my dear cassandra that you did not find my last letter very full of matter and i wish this may not have the same deficiency but we are doing nothing ourselves to write about and i am therefore quite dependent upon the communications of our friends or my own wits this post brought me two interesting letters yours and one from bookham in answer to an inquiry of mine about your good godmother of whom we had lately received a very alarming account from paragon miss arnold was the informant then and she spoke of mrs e l having been very dangerously ill and attended by a physician from oxford your letter to adlestrop may perhaps bring you information from the spot but in case it should not i must tell you that she is better though dr bourne cannot yet call her out of danger such was the case last wednesday and mrs cookes having had no later account is a favorable sign i am to hear again from the latter next week but not this if everything goes on well her disorder is an inflammation on the lungs arising from a severe chill taken in church last sunday three weeks her mind all pious composure as may be supposed george cooke was there when her illness began his brother has now taken his place her age and feebleness considered ones fears cannot but preponderate though her amendment has already surpassed the expectation of the physician at the beginning i am sorry to add that becky is laid up with a complaint of the same kind i am very glad to have the time of your return at all fixed we all rejoice in it and it will not be later than i had expected i dare not hope that mary and miss curling may be detained at portsmouth so long or half so long but it would be worth twopence to have it so the st albans perhaps may soon be off to help bring home what may remain by this time of our poor army whose state seems dreadfully critical the regency seems to have been heard of only here my most political correspondents make no mention of it unlucky that i should have wasted so much reflection on the subject i can now answer your question to my mother more at large and likewise more at smallwith equal perspicuity and minuteness for the very day of our leaving southampton is fixed and if the knowledge is of no use to edward i am sure it will give him pleasure easter monday april is the day we are to sleep that night at alton and be with our friends at bookham the next if they are then at home there we remain till the following monday and on tuesday april hope to be at godmersham if the cookes are absent we shall finish our journey on the th these plans depend of course upon the weather but i hope there will be no settled cold to delay us materially to make you amends for being at bookham it is in contemplation to spend a few days at baiton lodge in our way out of kent the hint of such a visit is most affectionately welcomed by mrs birch in one of her odd pleasant letters lately in which she speaks of us with the usual distinguished kindness declaring that she shall not be at all satisfied unless a very handsome present is made us immediately from one quarter fannys not coming with you is no more than we expected and as we have not the hope of a bed for her and shall see her so soon afterwards at godmersham we cannot wish it otherwise william will be quite recovered i trust by the time you receive this what a comfort his crossstitch must have been pray tell him that i should like to see his work very much i hope our answers this morning have given satisfaction we had great pleasure in uncle deedes packet and pray let marianne know in private that i think she is quite right to work a rug for uncle johns coffee urn and that i am sure it must give great pleasure to herself now and to him when he receives it the preference of brag over speculation does not greatly surprise me i believe because i feel the same myself but it mortifies me deeply because speculation was under my patronage and after all what is there so delightful in a pair royal of braggers it is but three nines or three knaves or a mixture of them when one comes to reason upon it it cannot stand its ground against speculationof which i hope edward is now convinced give my love to him if he is the letter from paragon before mentioned was much like those which had preceded it as to the felicity of its writer they found their house so dirty and so damp that they were obliged to be a week at an inn john binns had behaved most unhandsomely and engaged himself elsewhere they have a man however on the same footing which my aunt does not like and she finds both him and the new maidservant very very inferior to robert and martha whether they mean to have any other domestics does not appear nor whether they are to have a carriage while they are in bath the holders are as usual though i believe it is not very usual for them to be happy which they now are at a great rate in hoopers marriage the irvines are not mentioned the american lady improved as we went on but still the same faults in part recurred we are now in margiana and like it very well indeed we are just going to set off for northumberland to be shut up in widdrington tower where there must be two or three sets of victims already immured under a very fine villain wednesdayyour report of elizas health gives me great pleasure and the progress of the bank is a constant source of satisfaction with such increasing profits tell henry that i hope he will not work poor highdiddle so hard as he used to do has your newspaper given a sad story of a mrs middleton wife of a farmer in yorkshire her sister and servant being almost frozen to death in the late weather her little child quite so i hope the sister is not our friend miss woodd and i rather think her brotherinlaw had moved into lincolnshire but their name and station accord too well mrs m and the maid are said to be tolerably recovered but the sister is likely to lose the use of her limbs charless rug will be finished today and sent tomorrow to frank to be consigned by him to mr turners care and i am going to send marmion out with itvery generous in me i think as we have no letter from adlestrop we may suppose the good woman was alive on monday but i cannot help expecting bad news from thence or bookham in a few days do you continue quite well have you nothing to say of your little namesake we join in love and many happy returns yours affectionately j austen the manydown ball was a smaller thing than i expected but it seems to have made anna very happy at her age it would not have done for me miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent xxxii castle square tuesday january my dear cassandrai am happy to say that we had no second letter from bookham last week yours has brought its usual measure of satisfaction and amusement and i beg your acceptance of all the thanks due on the occasion your offer of cravats is very kind and happens to be particularly adapted to my wants but it was an odd thing to occur to you yes we have got another fall of snow and are very dreadful everything seems to turn to snow this winter i hope you have had no more illness among you and that william will be soon as well as ever his working a footstool for chawton is a most agreeable surprise to me and i am sure his grandmamma will value it very much as a proof of his affection and industry but we shall never have the heart to put our feet upon it i believe i must work a muslin cover in satin stitch to keep it from the dirt i long to know what his colors are i guess greens and purples edward and henry have started a difficulty respecting our journey which i must own with some confusion had never been thought of by us but if the former expected by it to prevent our travelling into kent entirely he will be disappointed for we have already determined to go the croydon road on leaving bookham and sleep at dartford will not that do there certainly does seem no convenient restingplace on the other road anna went to clanville last friday and i have hopes of her new aunts being really worth her knowing perhaps you may never have heard that james and mary paid a morning visit there in form some weeks ago and mary though by no means disposed to like her was very much pleased with her indeed her praise to be sure proves nothing more than mrs ms being civil and attentive to them but her being so is in favor of her having good sense mary writes of anna as improved in person but gives her no other commendation i am afraid her absence now may deprive her of one pleasure for that silly mr hammond is actually to give his ball on friday we had some reason to expect a visit from earle harwood and james this week but they do not come miss murden arrived last night at mrs hookeys as a message and a basket announced to us you will therefore return to an enlarged and of course improved society here especially as the miss williamses are come back we were agreeably surprised the other day by a visit from your beauty and mine each in a new cloth mantle and bonnet and i dare say you will value yourself much on the modest propriety of miss ws taste hers being purple and miss graces scarlet i can easily suppose that your six weeks here will be fully occupied were it only in lengthening the waists of your gowns i have pretty well arranged my spring and summer plans of that kind and mean to wear out my spotted muslin before i go you will exclaim at this but mine really has signs of feebleness which with a little care may come to something martha and dr mant are as bad as ever he runs after her in the street to apologize for having spoken to a gentleman while she was near him the day before poor mrs mant can stand it no longer she is retired to one of her married daughters when william returns to winchester mary jane is to go to mrs nunes for a month and then to steventon for a fortnight and it seems likely that she and her aunt martha may travel into berkshire together we shall not have a month of martha after your return and that month will be a very interrupted and broken one but we shall enjoy ourselves the more when we can get a quiet halfhour together to set against your new novel of which nobody ever heard before and perhaps never may again we have got ida of athens by miss owenson which must be very clever because it was written as the authoress says in three months we have only read the preface yet but her irish girl does not make me expect much if the warmth of her language could affect the body it might be worth reading in this weather adieu i must leave off to stir the fire and call on miss murden eveningi have done them both the first very often we found our friend as comfortable as she can ever allow herself to be in cold weather there is a very neat parlor behind the shop for her to sit in not very light indeed being à la southampton the middle of three deep but very lively from the frequent sound of the pestle and mortar we afterwards called on the miss williamses who lodge at durantoys miss mary only was at home and she is in very indifferent health dr hacket came in while we were there and said that he never remembered such a severe winter as this in southampton before it is bad but we do not suffer as we did last year because the wind has been more ne than nw for a day or two last week my mother was very poorly with a return of one of her old complaints but it did not last long and seems to have left nothing bad behind it she began to talk of a serious illness her two last having been preceded by the same symptoms but thank heaven she is now quite as well as one can expect her to be in weather which deprives her of exercise miss m conveys to us a third volume of sermons from hamstall just published and which we are to like better than the two others they are professedly practical and for the use of country congregations i have just received some verses in an unknown hand and am desired to forward them to my nephew edward at godmersham alas poor brag thou boastful game what now avails thine empty name where now thy more distinguished fame my day is oer and thine the same for thou like me art thrown aside at godmersham this christmastide and now across the table wide each game save brag or spec is tried such is the mild ejaculation of tenderhearted speculation wednesdayi expected to have a letter from somebody today but i have not twice every day i think of a letter from portsmouth miss murden has been sitting with us this morning as yet she seems very well pleased with her situation the worst part of her being in southampton will be the necessity of one walking with her now and then for she talks so loud that one is quite ashamed but our dining hours are luckily very different which we shall take all reasonable advantage of the queens birthday moves the assembly to this night instead of last and as it is always fully attended martha and i expect an amusing show we were in hopes of being independent of other companions by having the attendance of mr austen and captain harwood but as they fail us we are obliged to look out for other help and have fixed on the wallops as least likely to be troublesome i have called on them this morning and found them very willing and i am sorry that you must wait a whole week for the particulars of the evening i propose being asked to dance by our acquaintance mr smith now captain smith who has lately reappeared in southampton but i shall decline it he saw charles last august what an alarming bride mrs must have been such a parade is one of the most immodest pieces of modesty that one can imagine to attract notice could have been her only wish it augurs ill for her family it announces not great sense and therefore insures boundless influence i hope fannys visit is now taking place you have said scarcely anything of her lately but i trust you are as good friends as ever martha sends her love and hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you when you return to southampton you are to understand this message as being merely for the sake of a message to oblige me yours affectionately j austen henry never sent his love to me in your last but i send him mine miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent xxxiii castle square tuesday january my dear cassandrai will give you the indulgence of a letter on thursday this week instead of friday but i do not require you to write again before sunday provided i may believe you and your finger going on quite well take care of your precious self do not work too hard remember that aunt cassandras are quite as scarce as miss beverleys i had the happiness yesterday of a letter from charles but i shall say as little about it as possible because i know that excruciating henry will have had a letter likewise to make all my intelligence valueless it was written at bermuda on the th and th of december all well and fanny still only in expectation of being otherwise he had taken a small prize in his late cruisea french schooner laden with sugar but bad weather parted them and she had not yet been heard of his cruise ended december st my september letter was the latest he had received this day three weeks you are to be in london and i wish you better weather not but that you may have worse for we have now nothing but ceaseless snow or rain and insufferable dirt to complain of no tempestuous winds nor severity of cold since i wrote last we have had something of each but it is not genteel to rip up old grievances you used me scandalously by not mentioning edward coopers sermons i tell you everything and it is unknown the mysteries you conceal from me and to add to the rest you persevere in giving a final e to invalid thereby putting it out of ones power to suppose mrs e leigh even for a moment a veteran soldier she good woman is i hope destined for some further placid enjoyment of her own excellence in this world for her recovery advances exceedingly well i had this pleasant news in a letter from bookham last thursday but as the letter was from mary instead of her mother you will guess her account was not equally good from home mrs cooke had been confined to her bed some days by illness but was then better and mary wrote in confidence of her continuing to mend i have desired to hear again soon you rejoice me by what you say of fanny i hope she will not turn goodfornothing this ever so long we thought of and talked of her yesterday with sincere affection and wished her a long enjoyment of all the happiness to which she seems born while she gives happiness to those about her she is pretty sure of her own share i am gratified by her having pleasure in what i write but i wish the knowledge of my being exposed to her discerning criticism may not hurt my style by inducing too great a solicitude i begin already to weigh my words and sentences more than i did and am looking about for a sentiment an illustration or a metaphor in every corner of the room could my ideas flow as fast as the rain in the storecloset it would be charming we have been in two or three dreadful states within the last week from the melting of the snow etc and the contest between us and the closet has now ended in our defeat i have been obliged to move almost everything out of it and leave it to splash itself as it likes you have by no means raised my curiosity after caleb my disinclination for it before was affected but now it is real i do not like the evangelicals of course i shall be delighted when i read it like other people but till i do i dislike it i am sorry my verses did not bring any return from edward i was in hopes they might but i suppose he does not rate them high enough it might be partiality but they seemed to me purely classicaljust like homer and virgil ovid and propria que maribus i had a nice brotherly letter from frank the other day which after an interval of nearly three weeks was very welcome no orders were come on friday and none were come yesterday or we should have heard today i had supposed miss c would share her cousins room here but a message in this letter proves the contrary i will make the garret as comfortable as i can but the possibilities of that apartment are not great my mother has been talking to eliza about our future home and she making no difficulty at all of the sweetheart is perfectly disposed to continue with us but till she has written home for mothers approbation cannot quite decide mother does not like to have her so far off at chawton she will be nine or ten miles nearer which i hope will have its due influence as for sally she means to play john binns with us in her anxiety to belong to our household again hitherto she appears a very good servant you depend upon finding all your plants dead i hope they look very ill i understand your silence on the subject of our ball makes me suppose your curiosity too great for words we were very well entertained and could have stayed longer but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey me home and i did not like to keep them waiting in the cold the room was tolerably full and the ball opened by miss glyn the miss lances had partners captain dauvergnes friend appeared in regimentals caroline maitland had an officer to flirt with and mr john harrison was deputed by captain smith being himself absent to ask me to dance everything went well you see especially after we had tucked mrs lances neckerchief in behind and fastened it with a pin we had a very full and agreeable account of mr hammonds ball from anna last night the same fluent pen has sent similar information i know into kent she seems to have been as happy as one could wish her and the complacency of her mamma in doing the honors of the evening must have made her pleasure almost as great the grandeur of the meeting was beyond my hopes i should like to have seen annas looks and performance but that sad cropped head must have injured the former martha pleases herself with believing that if i had kept her counsel you would never have heard of dr ms late behavior as if the very slight manner in which i mentioned it could have been all on which you found your judgment i do not endeavor to undeceive her because i wish her happy at all events and know how highly she prizes happiness of any kind she is moreover so full of kindness for us both and sends you in particular so many good wishes about your finger that i am willing to overlook a venial fault and as dr m is a clergyman their attachment however immoral has a decorous air adieu sweet you this is grievous news from spain it is well that dr moore was spared the knowledge of such a sons death yours affectionately j austen annas hand gets better and better it begins to be too good for any consequence we send best love to dear little lizzy and marianne in particular the portsmouth paper gave a melancholy history of a poor mad woman escaped from confinement who said her husband and daughter of the name of payne lived at ashford in kent do you own them miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent footnotes cecilia beverley the heroine of miss burneys novel fanny austen afterward lady edward knatchbull xxxiv castle square monday january my dear cassandrai was not much surprised yesterday by the agreeable surprise of your letter and extremely glad to receive the assurance of your finger being well again here is such a wet day as never was seen i wish the poor little girls had better weather for their journey they must amuse themselves with watching the raindrops down the windows sackree i suppose feels quite brokenhearted i cannot have done with the weather without observing how delightfully mild it is i am sure fanny must enjoy it with us yesterday was a very blowing day we got to church however which we had not been able to do for two sundays before i am not at all ashamed about the name of the novel having been guilty of no insult toward your handwriting the diphthong i always saw but knowing how fond you were of adding a vowel wherever you could i attributed it to that alone and the knowledge of the truth does the book no service the only merit it could have was in the name of caleb which has an honest unpretending sound but in coelebs there is pedantry and affectation is it written only to classical scholars i shall now try to say only what is necessary i am weary of meandering so expect a vast deal of small matter concisely told in the next two pages mrs cooke has been very dangerously ill but is now i hope safe i had a letter last week from george mary being too busy to write and at that time the disorder was called of the typhus kind and their alarm considerable but yesterday brought me a much better account from mary the origin of the complaint being now ascertained to be bilious and the strong medicines requisite promising to be effectual mrs e l is so much recovered as to get into the dressingroom every day a letter from hamstall gives us the history of sir tho williamss return the admiral whoever he might he took a fancy to the neptune and having only a wornout to offer in lieu of it sir tho declined such a command and is come home passenger lucky man to have so fair an opportunity of escape i hope his wife allows herself to be happy on the occasion and does not give all her thoughts to being nervous a great event happens this week at hamstall in young edwards removal to school he is going to rugby and is very happy in the idea of it i wish his happiness may last but it will be a great change to become a raw schoolboy from being a pompous sermonwriter and a domineering brother it will do him good i dare say caroline has had a great escape from being burnt to death lately as her husband gives the account we must believe it true miss murden is gonecalled away by the critical state of mrs pottinger who has had another severe stroke and is without sense or speech miss murden wishes to return to southampton if circumstances suit but it must be very doubtful we have been obliged to turn away cholles he grew so very drunken and negligent and we have a man in his place called thomas martha desires me to communicate something concerning herself which she knows will give you pleasure as affording her very particular satisfactionit is that she is to be in town this spring with mrs dundas i need not dilate on the subject you understand enough of the whys and wherefores to enter into her feelings and to be conscious that of all possible arrangements it is the one most acceptable to her she goes to barton on leaving us and the family remove to town in april what you tell me of miss sharpe is quite new and surprises me a little i feel however as you do she is born poor thing to struggle with evil and her continuing with miss b is i hope a proof that matters are not always so very bad between them as her letters sometimes represent jennys marriage i had heard of and supposed you would do so too from steventon as i knew you were corresponding with mary at the time i hope she will not sully the respectable name she now bears your plan for miss curling is uncommonly considerate and friendly and such as she must surely jump at edwards going round by steventon as i understand he promises to do can be no reasonable objection mrs j austens hospitality is just of the kind to enjoy such a visitor we were very glad to know aunt fanny was in the country when we read of the fire pray give my best compliments to the mrs finches if they are at gm i am sorry to find that sir j moore has a mother living but though a very heroic son he might not be a very necessary one to her happiness deacon morrell may be more to mrs morrell i wish sir john had united something of the christian with the hero in his death thank heaven we have had no one to care for particularly among the troopsno one in fact nearer to us than sir john himself col maitland is safe and well his mother and sisters were of course anxious about him but there is no entering much into the solicitudes of that family my mother is well and gets out when she can with the same enjoyment and apparently the same strength as hitherto she hopes you will not omit begging mrs seward to get the garden cropped for us supposing she leaves the house too early to make the garden any object to herself we are very desirous of receiving your account of the house for your observations will have a motive which can leave nothing to conjecture and suffer nothing from want of memory for ones own dear self one ascertains and remembers everything lady sondes is an impudent woman to come back into her old neighborhood again i suppose she pretends never to have married before and wonders how her father and mother came to have her christened lady sondes the storecloset i hope will never do so again for much of the evil is proved to have proceeded from the gutter being choked up and we have had it cleared we had reason to rejoice in the childs absence at the time of the thaw for the nursery was not habitable we hear of similar disasters from almost everybody no news from portsmouth we are very patient mrs charles fowle desires to be kindly remembered to you she is warmly interested in my brother and his family yours very affectionately j austen miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent xxxv sloane st thursday april my dear cassandrai have so many little matters to tell you of that i cannot wait any longer before i begin to put them down i spent tuesday in bentinck street the cookes called here and took me back and it was quite a cooke day for the miss rolles paid a visit while i was there and sam arnold dropped in to tea the badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent plan of minethat of calling on miss beckford again but from the middle of the day it rained incessantly mary and i after disposing of her father and mother went to the liverpool museum and the british gallery and i had some amusement at each though my preference for men and women always inclines me to attend more to the company than the sight mrs cooke regrets very much that she did not see you when you called it was owing to a blunder among the servants for she did not know of our visit till we were gone she seems tolerably well but the nervous part of her complaint i fear increases and makes her more and more unwilling to part with mary i have proposed to the latter that she should go to chawton with me on the supposition of my travelling the guildford road and she i do believe would be glad to do it but perhaps it may be impossible unless a brother can be at home at that time it certainly must george comes to them today i did not see theo till late on tuesday he was gone to ilford but he came back in time to show his usual nothingmeaning harmless heartless civility henry who had been confined the whole day to the bank took me in his way home and after putting life and wit into the party for a quarter of an hour put himself and his sister into a hackney coach i bless my stars that i have done with tuesday but alas wednesday was likewise a day of great doings for manon and i took our walk to grafton house and i have a good deal to say on that subject i am sorry to tell you that i am getting very extravagant and spending all my money and what is worse for you i have been spending yours too for in a linendrapers shop to which i went for checked muslin and for which i was obliged to give seven shillings a yard i was tempted by a prettycolored muslin and bought ten yards of it on the chance of your liking it but at the same time if it should not suit you you must not think yourself at all obliged to take it it is only s d per yard and i should not in the least mind keeping the whole in texture it is just what we prefer but its resemblance to green crewels i must own is not great for the pattern is a small red spot and now i believe i have done all my commissions except wedgwood i liked my walk very much it was shorter than i had expected and the weather was delightful we set off immediately after breakfast and must have reached grafton house by halfpast eleven but when we entered the shop the whole counter was thronged and we waited full half an hour before we could be attended to when we were served however i was very well satisfied with my purchasesmy bugle trimming at s d and three pair silk stockings for a little less than s a pair in my way back who should i meet but mr moore just come from beckenham i believe he would have passed me if i had not made him stop but we were delighted to meet i soon found however that he had nothing new to tell me and then i let him go miss burton has made me a very pretty little bonnet and now nothing can satisfy me but i must have a straw hat of the ridinghat shape like mrs tilsons and a young woman in this neighborhood is actually making me one i am really very shocking but it will not be dear at a guinea our pelisses are s each she charges only s for the making but the buttons seem expensiveare expensive i might have said for the fact is plain enough we drank tea again yesterday with the tilsons and met the smiths i find all these little parties very pleasant i like mrs s miss beaty is goodhumor itself and does not seem much besides we spend tomorrow evening with them and are to meet the coln and mrs cantelo smith you have been used to hear of and if she is in good humor are likely to have excellent singing tonight i might have been at the play henry had kindly planned our going together to the lyceum but i have a cold which i should not like to make worse before saturday so i stay within all this day eliza is walking out by herself she has plenty of business on her hands just now for the day of the party is settled and drawing near above eighty people are invited for next tuesday evening and there is to be some very good musicfive professionals three of them glee singers besides amateurs fanny will listen to this one of the hirelings is a capital on the harp from which i expect great pleasure the foundation of the party was a dinner to henry egerton and henry walter but the latter leaves town the day before i am sorry as i wished her prejudice to be done away but should have been more sorry if there had been no invitation i am a wretch to be so occupied with all these things as to seem to have no thoughts to give to people and circumstances which really supply a far more lasting interestthe society in which you are but i do think of you all i assure you and want to know all about everybody and especially about your visit to the w friars mais le moyen not to be occupied by ones own concerns saturdayfrank is superseded in the caledonia henry brought us this news yesterday from mr daysh and he heard at the same time that charles may be in england in the course of a month sir edward pollen succeeds lord gambier in his command and some captain of his succeeds frank and i believe the order is already gone out henry means to inquire further today he wrote to mary on the occasion this is something to think of henry is convinced that he will have the offer of something else but does not think it will be at all incumbent on him to accept it and then follows what will he do and where will he live i hope to hear from you today how are you as to health strength looks etc i had a very comfortable account from chawton yesterday if the weather permits eliza and i walk into london this morning she is in want of chimney lights for tuesday and i of an ounce of darningcotton she has resolved not to venture to the play tonight the dentraigues and comte julien cannot come to the party which was at first a grief but she has since supplied herself so well with performers that it is of no consequence their not coming has produced our going to them tomorrow evening which i like the idea of it will be amusing to see the ways of a french circle i wrote to mrs hill a few days ago and have received a most kind and satisfactory answer any time the first week in may exactly suits her and therefore i consider my going as tolerably fixed i shall leave sloane street on the st or d and be ready for james on the th and if his plan alters i can take care of myself i have explained my views here and everything is smooth and pleasant and eliza talks kindly of conveying me to streatham we met the tilsons yesterday evening but the singing smiths sent an excuse which put our mrs smith out of humor we are come back after a good dose of walking and coaching and i have the pleasure of your letter i wish i had jamess verses but they were left at chawton when i return thither if mrs k will give me leave i will send them to her our first object today was henrietta st to consult with henry in consequence of a very unlucky change of the play for this very nighthamlet instead of king johnand we are to go on monday to macbeth instead but it is a disappointment to us both love to all yours affectionately jane miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham kent xxxvi sloane st thursday april my dearest cassandrai can return the compliment by thanking you for the unexpected pleasure of your letter yesterday and as i like unexpected pleasure it made me very happy and indeed you need not apologize for your letter in any respect for it is all very fine but not too fine i hope to be written again or something like it i think edward will not suffer much longer from heat by the look of things this morning i suspect the weather is rising into the balsamic northeast it has been hot here as you may suppose since it was so hot with you but i have not suffered from it at all nor felt it in such a degree as to make me imagine it would be anything in the country everybody has talked of the heat but i set it all down to london i give you joy of our new nephew and hope if he ever comes to be hanged it will not be till we are too old to care about it it is a great comfort to have it so safely and speedily over the miss curlings must be hard worked in writing so many letters but the novelty of it may recommend it to them mine was from miss eliza and she says that my brother may arrive today no indeed i am never too busy to think of s and s i can no more forget it than a mother can forget her sucking child and i am much obliged to you for your inquiries i have had two sheets to correct but the last only brings us to willoughbys first appearance mrs k regrets in the most flattering manner that she must wait till may but i have scarcely a hope of its being out in june henry does not neglect it he has hurried the printer and says he will see him again today it will not stand still during his absence it will be sent to eliza the incomes remain as they were but i will get them altered if i can i am very much gratified by mrs ks interest in it and whatever may be the event of it as to my credit with her sincerely wish her curiosity could be satisfied sooner than is now probable i think she will like my elinor but cannot build on anything else our party went off extremely well there were many solicitudes alarms and vexations beforehand of course but at last everything was quite right the rooms were dressed up with flowers etc and looked very pretty a glass for the mantelpiece was lent by the man who is making their own mr egerton and mr walter came at halfpast five and the festivities began with a pair of very fine soles yes mr walterfor he postponed his leaving london on purposewhich did not give much pleasure at the time any more than the circumstance from which it rosehis calling on sunday and being asked by henry to take the family dinner on that day which he did but it is all smoothed over now and she likes him very well at halfpast seven arrived the musicians in two hackney coaches and by eight the lordly company began to appear among the earliest were george and mary cooke and i spent the greatest part of the evening very pleasantly with them the drawingroom being soon hotter than we liked we placed ourselves in the connecting passage which was comparatively cool and gave us all the advantage of the music at a pleasant distance as well as that of the first view of every newcomer i was quite surrounded by acquaintance especially gentlemen and what with mr hampson mr seymour mr w knatchbull mr guillemarde mr cure a captain simpson brother to the captain simpson besides mr walter and mr egerton in addition to the cookes and miss beckford and miss middleton i had quite as much upon my hands as i could do poor miss b has been suffering again from her old complaint and looks thinner than ever she certainly goes to cheltenham the beginning of june we were all delight and cordiality of course miss m seems very happy but has not beauty enough to figure in london including everybody we were sixtysixwhich was considerably more than eliza had expected and quite enough to fill the back drawingroom and leave a few to be scattered about in the other and in the passage the music was extremely good it opened tell fanny with poike de parp pirs praise pof prapela and of the other glees i remember in peace love tunes rosabelle the red cross knight and poor insect between the songs were lessons on the harp or harp and pianoforte together and the harpplayer was wiepart whose name seems famous though new to me there was one female singer a short miss davis all in blue bringing up for the public line whose voice was said to be very fine indeed and all the performers gave great satisfaction by doing what they were paid for and giving themselves no airs no amateur could be persuaded to do anything the house was not clear till after twelve if you wish to hear more of it you must put your questions but i seem rather to have exhausted than spared the subject this said captain simpson told us on the authority of some other captain just arrived from halifax that charles was bringing the cleopatra home and that she was probably by this time in the channel but as captain s was certainly in liquor we must not quite depend on it it must give one a sort of expectation however and will prevent my writing to him any more i would rather he should not reach england till i am at home and the steventon party gone my mother and martha both write with great satisfaction of annas behavior she is quite an anna with variations but she cannot have reached her last for that is always the most flourishing and showy she is at about her third or fourth which are generally simple and pretty your lilacs are in leaf ours are in bloom the horsechestnuts are quite out and the elms almost i had a pleasant walk in kensington gardens on sunday with henry mr smith and mr tilson everything was fresh and beautiful we did go to the play after all on saturday we went to the lyceum and saw the hypocrite an old play taken from molières tartuffe and were well entertained dowton and mathews were the good actors mrs edwin was the heroine and her performance is just what it used to be i have no chance of seeing mrs siddons she did act on monday but as henry was told by the boxkeeper that he did not think she would the plans and all thought of it were given up i should particularly have liked seeing her in constance and could swear at her with little effort for disappointing me henry has been to the watercolor exhibition which opened on monday and is to meet us there again some morning if eliza cannot go and she has a cold at present miss beaty will be invited to be my companion henry leaves town on sunday afternoon but he means to write soon himself to edward and will tell his own plans the tea is this moment setting out do not have your colored muslin unless you really want it because i am afraid i could not send it to the coach without giving trouble here eliza caught her cold on sunday in our way to the dentraigues the horses actually gibbed on this side of hyde park gate a load of fresh gravel made it a formidable hill to them and they refused the collar i believe there was a sore shoulder to irritate eliza was frightened and we got out and were detained in the evening air several minutes the cold is in her chest but she takes care of herself and i hope it may not last long this engagement prevented mr walters staying latehe had his coffee and went away eliza enjoyed her evening very much and means to cultivate the acquaintance and i see nothing to dislike in them but their taking quantities of snuff monsieur the old count is a very finelooking man with quiet manners good enough for an englishman and i believe is a man of great information and taste he has some fine paintings which delighted henry as much as the sons music gratified eliza and among them a miniature of philip v of spain louis xivs grandson which exactly suited my capacity count juliens performance is very wonderful we met only mrs latouche and miss east and we are just now engaged to spend next sunday evening at mrs ls and to meet the dentraigues but m le comte must do without henry if he would but speak english i would take to him have you ever mentioned the leaving off tea to mrs k eliza has just spoken of it again the benefit she has found from it in sleeping has been very great i shall write soon to catherine to fix my day which will be thursday we have no engagement but for sunday elizas cold makes quiet advisable her party is mentioned in this mornings paper i am sorry to hear of poor fannys state from that quarter i suppose is to be the alloy of her happiness i will have no more to say yours affectionately j a give my love particularly to my goddaughter miss austen edward austens esq godmersham park faversham footnote sense and sensibility xxxvii sloane st tuesday my dear cassandrai had sent off my letter yesterday before yours came which i was sorry for but as eliza has been so good as to get me a frank your questions shall be answered without much further expense to you the best direction to henry at oxford will be the blue boar cornmarket i do not mean to provide another trimming for my pelisse for i am determined to spend no more money so i shall wear it as it is longer than i ought and theni do not know my headdress was a bugleband like the border to my gown and a flower of mrs tilsons i depended upon hearing something of the evening from mr w k and am very well satisfied with his notice of mea pleasinglooking young womanthat must do one cannot pretend to anything better now thankful to have it continued a few years longer it gives me sincere pleasure to hear of mrs knights having had a tolerable night at last but upon this occasion i wish she had another name for the two nights jingle very much we have tried to get selfcontrol but in vain i should like to know what her estimate is but am always half afraid of finding a clever novel too clever and of finding my own story and my own people all forestalled eliza has just received a few lines from henry to assure her of the good conduct of his mare he slept at uxbridge on sunday and wrote from wheatfield we were not claimed by hans place yesterday but are to dine there today mr tilson called in the evening but otherwise we were quite alone all day and after having been out a good deal the change was very pleasant i like your opinion of miss atten much better than i expected and have now hopes of her staying a whole twelvemonth by this time i suppose she is hard at it governing away poor creature i pity her though they are my nieces oh yes i remember miss emma plumbtrees local consequence perfectly i am in a dilemma for want of an emma escaped from the lips of henry gipps but really i was never much more put to it than in continuing an answer to fannys former message what is there to be said on the subject pery pell or pare pey or po or at the most pi pope pey pike pit i congratulate edward on the weald of kent canal bill being put off till another session as i have just had the pleasure of reading there is always something to be hoped from delay between session and session the first prepossession may rouse up the nation and the villanous bill may be forced to lie still against wicked mens will there is poetry for edward and his daughter i am afraid i shall not have any for you i forgot to tell you in my last that our cousin miss payne called in on saturday and was persuaded to stay dinner she told us a great deal about her friend lady cath brecknell who is most happily married and mr brecknell is very religious and has got black whiskers i am glad to think that edward has a tolerable day for his drive to goodnestone and very glad to hear of his kind promise of bringing you to town i hope everything will arrange itself favorably the th is now to be mrs dundass day i mean if i can to wait for your return before i have my new gown made up from a notion of their making up to more advantage together and as i find the muslin is not so wide as it used to be some contrivance may be necessary i expect the skirt to require onehalf breadth cut in gores besides two whole breadths eliza has not yet quite resolved on inviting anna but i think she will yours very affectionately jane xxxviii chawton wednesday may it was a mistake of mine my dear cassandra to talk of a tenth child at hamstall i had forgot there were but eight already your inquiry after my uncle and aunt were most happily timed for the very same post brought an account of them they are again at gloucester house enjoying fresh air which they seem to have felt the want of in bath and are tolerably well but not more than tolerable my aunt does not enter into particulars but she does not write in spirits and we imagine that she has never entirely got the better of her disorder in the winter mrs welby takes her out airing in her barouche which gives her a headachea comfortable proof i suppose of the uselessness of the new carriage when they have got it you certainly must have heard before i can tell you that col orde has married our cousin margt beckford the marchess of douglass sister the papers say that her father disinherits her but i think too well of an orde to suppose that she has not a handsome independence of her own illustration chawton cottage from the garden letters the chickens are all alive and fit for the table but we save them for something grand some of the flower seeds are coming up very well but your mignonette makes a wretched appearance miss benn has been equally unlucky as to hers she had seed from four different people and none of it comes up our young piony at the foot of the firtree has just blown and looks very handsome and the whole of the shrubbery border will soon be very gay with pinks and sweetwilliams in addition to the columbines already in bloom the syringas too are coming out we are likely to have a great crop of orleans plums but not many greengageson the standard scarcely any three or four dozen perhaps against the wall i believe i told you differently when i first came home but i can now judge better than i could then i have had a medley and satisfactory letter this morning from the husband and wife at cowes and in consequence of what is related of their plans we have been talking over the possibility of inviting them here in their way from steventon which is what one should wish to do and is i dare say what they expect but supposing martha to be at home it does not seem a very easy thing to accommodate so large a party my mother offers to give up her room to frank and mary but there will then be only the best for two maids and three children they go to steventon about the d and i guessfor it is quite a guesswill stay there from a fortnight to three weeks i must not venture to press miss sharpes coming at present we may hardly be at liberty before august poor john bridges we are very sorry for his situation and for the distress of the family lady b is in one way severely tried and our own dear brother suffers a great deal i dare say on the occasion i have not much to say of ourselves anna is nursing a cold caught in the arbor at faringdon that she may be able to keep her engagement to maria m this evening when i suppose she will make it worse she did not return from faringdon till sunday when h b walked home with her and drank tea here she was with the prowtings almost all monday she went to learn to make feather trimmings of miss anna and they kept her to dinner which was rather lucky as we were called upon to meet mrs and miss terry the same evening at the digweeds and though anna was of course invited too i think it always safest to keep her away from the family lest she should be doing too little or too much mrs terry mary and robert with my aunt harding and her daughter came from dummer for a day and a nightall very agreeable and very much delighted with the new house and with chawton in general we sat upstairs and had thunder and lightning as usual i never knew such a spring for thunderstorms as it has been thank god we have had no bad ones here i thought myself in luck to have my uncomfortable feelings shared by the mistress of the house as that procured blinds and candles it had been excessively hot the whole day mrs harding is a goodlooking woman but not much like mrs toke inasmuch as she is very brown and has scarcely any teeth she seems to have some of mrs tokes civility miss h is an elegant pleasing prettylooking girl about nineteen i suppose or nineteen and a half or nineteen and a quarter with flowers in her head and music at her fingerends she plays very well indeed i have seldom heard anybody with more pleasure they were at godington four or five years ago my cousin flora long was there last year my name is diana how does fanny like it what a change in the weather we have a fire again now harriet benn sleeps at the great house tonight and spends tomorrow with us and the plan is that we should all walk with her to drink tea at faringdon for her mother is now recovered but the state of the weather is not very promising at present miss benn has been returned to her cottage since the beginning of last week and has now just got another girl she comes from alton for many days miss b had nobody with her but her niece elizabeth who was delighted to be her visitor and her maid they both dined here on saturday while anna was at faringdon and last night an accidental meeting and a sudden impulse produced miss benn and maria middleton at our teatable if you have not heard it is very fit you should that mr harrison has had the living of fareham given him by the bishop and is going to reside there and now it is said that mr peach beautiful wiseacre wants to have the curacy of overton and if he does leave wootton james digweed wishes to go there fare you well

a little as if he meant to catch all his company tolerable gravel miss austen godmersham park faversham kent xxxix chawton thursday june by this time my dearest cassandra you know marthas plans i was rather disappointed i confess to find that she could not leave town till after ye th as i had hoped to see you here the week before the delay however is not great and everything seems generally arranging itself for your return very comfortably i found henry perfectly predisposed to bring you to london if agreeable to yourself he has not fixed his day for going into kent but he must be back again before ye th you may therefore think with something like certainty of the close of your godmersham visit and will have i suppose about a week for sloane street he travels in his gig and should the weather be tolerable i think you must have a delightful journey i have given up all idea of miss sharpes travelling with you and martha for though you are both all compliance with my scheme yet as you knock off a week from the end of her visit and martha rather more from the beginning the thing is out of the question i have written to her to say that after the middle of july we shall be happy to receive her and i have added a welcome if she could make her way hither directly but i do not expect that she will i have also sent our invitation to cowes we are very sorry for the disappointment you have all had in lady bs illness but a division of the proposed party is with you by this time and i hope may have brought you a better account of the rest give my love and thanks to harriot who has written me charming things of your looks and diverted me very much by poor mrs c milless continued perplexity i had a few lines from henry on tuesday to prepare us for himself and his friend and by the time that i had made the sumptuous provision of a neck of mutton on the occasion they drove into the court but lest you should not immediately recollect in how many hours a neck of mutton may be certainly procured i add that they came a little after twelveboth tall and well and in their different degrees agreeable it was a visit of only twentyfour hours but very pleasant while it lasted mr tilson took a sketch of the great house before dinner and after dinner we all three walked to chawton park meaning to go into it but it was too dirty and we were obliged to keep on the outside mr tilson admired the trees very much but grieved that they should not be turned into money my mothers cold is better and i believe she only wants dry weather to be very well it was a great distress to her that anna should be absent during her uncles visit a distress which i could not share she does not return from faringdon till this evening and i doubt not has had plenty of the miscellaneous unsettled sort of happiness which seems to suit her best we hear from miss benn who was on the common with the prowtings that she was very much admired by the gentlemen in general i like your new bonnets exceedingly yours is a shape which always looks well and i think fannys particularly becoming to her on monday i had the pleasure of receiving unpacking and approving our wedgwood ware it all came very safely and upon the whole is a good match though i think they might have allowed us rather larger leaves especially in such a year of fine foliage as this one is apt to suppose that the woods about birmingham must be blighted there was no bill with the goods but that shall not screen them from being paid i mean to ask martha to settle the account it will be quite in her way for she is just now sending my mother a breakfastset from the same place i hope it will come by the wagon tomorrow it is certainly what we want and i long to know what it is like and as i am sure martha has great pleasure in making the present i will not have any regret we have considerable dealings with the wagons at present a hamper of port and brandy from southampton is now in the kitchen your answer about the miss plumbtrees proves you as fine a daniel as ever portia was for i maintained emma to be the eldest we began pease on sunday but our gatherings are very small not at all like the gathering in the lady of the lake yesterday i had the agreeable surprise of finding several scarlet strawberries quite ripe had you been at home this would have been a pleasure lost there are more gooseberries and fewer currants than i thought at first we must buy currants for our wine the digweeds are gone down to see the stephen terrys at southampton and catch the kings birthday at portsmouth miss papillon called on us yesterday looking handsomer than ever maria middleton and miss benn dine here tomorrow we are not to enclose any more letters to abingdon street as perhaps martha has told you i had just left off writing and put on my things for walking to alton when anna and her friend harriot called in their way thither so we went together their business was to provide mourning against the kings death and my mother has had a bombazine bought for her i am not sorry to be back again for the young ladies had a great deal to do and without much method in doing it anna does not come home till tomorrow morning she has written i find to fanny but there does not seem to be a great deal to relate of tuesday i had hoped there might be dancing mrs budd died on sunday evening i saw her two days before her death and thought it must happen soon she suffered much from weakness and restlessness almost to the last poor little harriot seems truly grieved you have never mentioned harry how is

chawton the trees are magnificent xl chawton friday january i hope you received my little parcel by j bond on wednesday evening my dear cassandra and that you will be ready to hear from me again on sunday for i feel that i must write to you today i want to tell you that i have got my own darling child from london on wednesday i received one copy sent down by falkener with three lines from henry to say that he had given another to charles and sent a third by the coach to godmersham the advertisement is in our paper today for the first time s he shall ask l s for my two next and l s for my stupidest of all miss b dined with us on the very day of the books coming and in the evening we fairly set at it and read half the first vol to her prefacing that having intelligence from henry that such a work would soon appear we had desired him to send it whenever it came out and i believe it passed with her unsuspected she was amused poor soul that she could not help you know with two such people to lead the way but she really does seem to admire elizabeth i must confess that i think her as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print and how i shall be able to tolerate those who do not like her at least i do not know there are a few typical errors and a said he or a said she would sometimes make the dialogue more immediately clear but i do not write for such dull elves as have not a great deal of ingenuity themselves the second volume is shorter than i could wish but the difference is not so much in reality as in look there being a larger proportion of narrative in that part i have lopt and cropt so successfully however that i imagine it must be rather shorter than sense and sensibility altogether now i will try and write of something else footnote pride and prejudice xli chawton thursday february my dear cassandrayour letter was truly welcome and i am much obliged to you for all your praise it came at a right time for i had had some fits of disgust our second evenings reading to miss b had not pleased me so well but i believe something must be attributed to my mothers too rapid way of getting on though she perfectly understands the characters herself she cannot speak as they ought upon the whole however i am quite vain enough and well satisfied enough the work is rather too light and bright and sparkling it wants shade it wants to be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense if it could be had if not of solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the storyan essay on writing a critique on walter scott or the history of buonaparte or something that would form a contrast and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness and epigrammatism of the general style the greatest blunder in the printing that i have met with is in page v where two speeches are made into one there might as well be no suppers at longbourn but i suppose it was the remains of mrs bennets old meryton habits xlii february this will be a quick return for yours my dear cassandra i doubt its having much else to recommend it but there is no saying it may turn out to be a very long and delightful letter i am exceedingly pleased that you can say what you do after having gone through the whole work and fannys praise is very gratifying my hopes were tolerably strong of her but nothing like a certainty her liking darcy and elizabeth is enough she might hate all the others if she would i have her opinion under her own hand this morning but your transcript of it which i read first was not and is not the less acceptable to me it is of course all praise but the more exact truth which she sends you is good enough our party on wednesday was not unagreeable though we wanted a master of the house less anxious and fidgety and more conversable upon mrs s mentioning that she had sent the rejected addresses to mrs h i began talking to her a little about them and expressed my hope of their having amused her her answer was oh dear yes very much very droll indeed the opening of the house and the striking up of the fiddles what she meant poor woman who shall say i sought no farther as soon as a whistparty was formed and a round table threatened i made my mother an excuse and came away leaving just as many for their round table as there were at mrs grants i wish they might be as agreeable a set my mother is very well and finds great amusement in gloveknitting and at present wants no other work we quite run over with books she has got sir john carrs travels in spain and i am reading a society octavo an essay on the military police and institutions of the british empire by capt pasley of the engineersa book which i protested against at first but which upon trial i find delightfully written and highly entertaining i am as much in love with the author as i ever was with clarkson or buchanan or even the two mr smiths of the city the first soldier i ever sighed for but he does write with extraordinary force and spirit yesterday moreover brought us mrs grants letters with mr whites compliments but i have disposed of them compliments and all to miss p and amongst so many readers or retainers of books as we have in chawton i dare say there will be no difficulty in getting rid of them for another fortnight if necessary i have disposed of mrs grant for the second fortnight to mrs it can make no difference to her which of the twentysix fortnights in the year the three vols lie on her table i have been applied to for information as to the oath taken in former times of bell book and candle but have none to give perhaps you may be able to learn something of its origin where you now are ladies who read those enormous great stupid thick quarto volumes which one always sees in the breakfastparlor there must be acquainted with everything in the world i detest a quarto captain pasleys book is too good for their society they will not understand a man who condenses his thoughts into an octavo i have learned from sir j carr that there is no government house at gibraltar i must alter it to the commissioners footnote at this time february mansfield park was nearly finished xliii sloane street thursday may my dear cassandrabefore i say anything else i claim a paper full of halfpence on the drawingroom mantelpiece i put them there myself and forgot to bring them with me i cannot say that i have yet been in any distress for money but i choose to have my due as well as the devil how lucky we were in our weather yesterday this wet morning makes one more sensible of it we had no rain of any consequence the head of the curricle was put half up three or four times but our share of the showers was very trifling though they seemed to be heavy all round us when we were on the hogsback and i fancied it might then be raining so hard at chawton as to make you feel for us much more than we deserved three hours and a quarter took us to guildford where we stayed barely two hours and had only just time enough for all we had to do there that is eating a long and comfortable breakfast watching the carriages paying mr harrington and taking a little stroll afterwards from some views which that stroll gave us i think most highly of the situation of guildford we wanted all our brothers and sisters to be standing with us in the bowlinggreen and looking towards horsham i was very lucky in my glovesgot them at the first shop i went to though i went into it rather because it was near than because it looked at all like a gloveshop and gave only four shillings for them after which everybody at chawton will be hoping and predicting that they cannot be good for anything and their worth certainly remains to be proved but i think they look very well we left guildford at twenty minutes before twelve i hope somebody cares for these minutiæ and were at esher in about two hours more i was very much pleased with the country in general between guildford and ripley i thought it particularly pretty also about painshill and from a mr spicers grounds at esher which we walked into before dinner the views were beautiful i cannot say what we did not see but i should think there could not be a wood or a meadow or palace or remarkable spot in england that was not spread out before us on one side or other claremont is going to be sold a mr ellis has it now it is a house that seems never to have prospered after dinner we walked forward to be overtaken at the coachmans time and before he did overtake us we were very near kingston i fancy it was about halfpast six when we reached this housea twelve hours business and the horses did not appear more than reasonably tired i was very tired too and glad to get to bed early but am quite well today i am very snug in the front drawingroom all to myself and would not say thank you for any company but you the quietness of it does me good i have contrived to pay my two visits though the weather made me a great while about it and left me only a few minutes to sit with charlotte craven she looks very well and her hair is done up with an elegance to do credit to any education her manners are as unaffected and pleasing as ever she had heard from her mother today mrs craven spends another fortnight at chilton i saw nobody but charlotte which pleased me best i was shown upstairs into a drawingroom where she came to me and the appearance of the room so totally unschoollike amused me very much it was full of modern elegances yours very affectly j a footnote the present lady pollen of redenham near andover then at a school in london xliv sloane street monday may my dearest cassandrai am very much obliged to you for writing to me you must have hated it after a worrying morning your letter came just in time to save my going to remnants and fit me for christians where i bought fannys dimity i went the day before friday to laytons as i proposed and got my mothers gownseven yards at s d i then walked into no which is all dirt and confusion but in a very promising way and after being present at the opening of a new account to my great amusement henry and i went to the exhibition in spring gardens it is not thought a good collection but i was very well pleased particularly pray tell fanny with a small portrait of mrs bingley excessively like her i went in hopes of seeing one of her sister but there was no mrs darcy perhaps however i may find her in the great exhibition which we shall go to if we have time i have no chance of her in the collection of sir joshua reynoldss paintings which is now showing in pall mall and which we are also to visit mrs bingleys is exactly herselfsize shaped face features and sweetness there never was a greater likeness she is dressed in a white gown with green ornaments which convinces me of what i had always supposed that green was a favorite color with her i dare say mrs d will be in yellow friday was our worst day as to weather we were out in a very long and very heavy storm of hail and there had been others before but i heard no thunder saturday was a good deal better dry and cold i gave s d for the dimity i do not boast of any bargains but think both the sarsenet and dimity good of their sort i have bought your locket but was obliged to give s for it which must be rather more than you intended it is neat and plain set in gold we were to have gone to the somerset house exhibition on saturday but when i reached henrietta street mr hampson was wanted there and mr tilson and i were obliged to drive about town after him and by the time we had done it was too late for anything but home we never found him after all i have been interrupted by mrs tilson poor woman she is in danger of not being able to attend lady drummond smiths party tonight miss burdett was to have taken her and now miss burdett has a cough and will not go my cousin caroline is her sole dependence the events of yesterday were our going to belgrave chapel in the morning our being prevented by the rain from going to evening service at st james mr hampsons calling messrs barlow and phillips dining here and mr and mrs tilsons coming in the evening à lordinaire she drank tea with us both thursday and saturday he dined out each day and on friday we were with them and they wish us to go to them tomorrow evening to meet miss burdett but i do not know how it will end henry talks of a drive to hampstead which may interfere with it i should like to see miss burdett very well but that i am rather frightened by hearing that she wishes to be introduced to me if i am a wild beast i cannot help it it is not my own fault there is no change in our plan of leaving london but we shall not be with you before tuesday henry thinks monday would appear too early a day there is no danger of our being induced to stay longer i have not quite determined how i shall manage about my clothes perhaps there may be only my trunk to send by the coach or there may be a bandbox with it i have taken your gentle hint and written to mrs hill the hoblyns want us to dine with them but we have refused when henry returns he will be dining out a great deal i dare say as he will then be alone it will be more desirable he will be more welcome at every table and every invitation more welcome to him he will not want either of us again till he is settled in henrietta street this is my present persuasion and he will not be settled therereally settledtill late in the autumn he will not be come to bide till after september there is a gentleman in treaty for this house gentleman himself is in the country but gentlemans friend came to see it the other day and seemed pleased on the whole gentleman would rather prefer an increased rent to parting with five hundred guineas at once and if that is the only difficulty it will not be minded henry is indifferent as to the which get us the best weather you can for wednesday thursday and friday we are to go to windsor in our way to henley which will be a great delight we shall be leaving sloane street about twelve two or three hours after charless party have begun their journey you will miss them but the comfort of getting back into your own room will be great and then the tea and sugar i fear miss clewes is not better or you would have mentioned it i shall not write again unless i have any unexpected communication or opportunity to tempt me i enclose mr heringtons bill and receipt i am very much obliged to fanny for her letter it made me laugh heartily but i cannot pretend to answer it even had i more time i should not feel at all sure of the sort of letter that miss d would write i hope miss benn is got well again and will have a comfortable dinner with you today monday eveningwe have been both to the exhibition and sir j reynoldss and i am disappointed for there was nothing like mrs d at either i can only imagine that mr d prizes any picture of her too much to like it should be exposed to the public eye i can imagine he would have that sort of feelingthat mixture of love pride and delicacy setting aside this disappointment i had great amusement among the pictures and the driving about the carriage being open was very pleasant i liked my solitary elegance very much and was ready to laugh all the time at my being where i was i could not but feel that i had naturally small right to be parading about london in a barouche henry desires edward may know that he has just bought three dozen of claret for him cheap and ordered it to be sent down to chawton i should not wonder if we got no farther than reading on thursday evening and so reach steventon only to a reasonable dinnerhour the next day but whatever i may write or you may imagine we know it will be something different i shall be quiet tomorrow morning all my business is done and i shall only call again upon mrs hoblyn etc love to your much party yours affectionately j austen footnotes vide pride and prejudice miss darcy xlv henrietta st wednesday sept past here i am my dearest cassandra seated in the breakfast dining sitting room beginning with all my might fanny will join me as soon as she is dressed and begin her letter we had a very good journey weather and roads excellent the three first stages for s d and our only misadventure the being delayed about a quarter of an hour at kingston for horses and being obliged to put up with a pair belonging to a hackney coach and their coachman which left no room on the barouche box for lizzy who was to have gone her last stage there as she did the first consequently we were all four within which was a little crowded we arrived at a quarterpast four and were kindly welcomed by the coachman and then by his master and then by william and then by mrs pengird who all met us before we reached the foot of the stairs mde bigion was below dressing us a most comfortable dinner of soup fish bouillée partridges and an apple tart which we sat down to soon after five after cleaning and dressing ourselves and feeling that we were most commodiously disposed of the little adjoining dressingroom to our apartment makes fanny and myself very well off indeed and as we have poor elizas bed our space is ample every way sace arrived safely about halfpast six at seven we set off in a coach for the lyceum were at home again in about four hours and a half had soup and wine and water and then went to our holes edward finds his quarters very snug and quiet i must get a softer pen this is harder i am in agonies i have not yet seen mr crabbe marthas letter is gone to the post i am going to write nothing but short sentences there shall be two full stops in every line layton and shears is bedford house we mean to get there before breakfast if its possible for we feel more and more how much we have to do and how little time this house looks very nice it seems like sloane street moved here i believe henry is just rid of sloane street fanny does not come but i have edward seated by me beginning a letter which looks natural henry has been suffering from the pain in the face which he has been subject to before he caught cold at matlock and since his return has been paying a little for past pleasure it is nearly removed now but he looks thin in the face either from the pain or the fatigues of his tour which must have been great lady robert is delighted with p and p and really was so as i understand before she knew who wrote it for of course she knows now he told her with as much satisfaction as if it were my wish he did not tell me this but he told fanny and mr hastings i am quite delighted with what such a man writes about it henry sent him the books after his return from daylesford but you will hear the letter too let me be rational and return to my two full stops i talked to henry at the play last night we were in a private boxmr spencerswhich made it much more pleasant the box is directly on the stage one is infinitely less fatigued than in the common way but henrys plans are not what one could wish he does not mean to be at chawton till the th he must be in town again by oct his plan is to get a couple of days of pheasant shooting and then return directly his wish was to bring you back with him i have told him your scruples he wishes you to suit yourself as to time and if you cannot come till later will send for you at any time as far as bagshot he presumed you would not find difficulty in getting so far i could not say you would he proposed your going with him into oxfordshire it was his own thought at first i could not but catch at it for you we have talked of it again this morning for now we have breakfasted and i am convinced that if you can make it suit in other respects you need not scruple on his account if you cannot come back with him on the rd or th therefore i do hope you will contrive to go to adlestrop by not beginning your absence till about the middle of this month i think you may manage it very well but you will think all this over one could wish he had intended to come to you earlier but it cannot be helped i said nothing to him of mrs h and miss b that he might not suppose difficulties shall not you put them into our own room this seems to me the best plan and the maid will be most conveniently near oh dear me when i shall ever have done we did go to layton and shears before breakfast very pretty english poplins at s d irish ditto at s more pretty certainlybeautiful fanny and the two little girls are gone to take places for tonight at covent garden clandestine marriage and midas the latter will be a fine show for l and m they revelled last night in don juan whom we left in hell at halfpast eleven we had scaramouch and a ghost and were delighted i speak of them my delight was very tranquil and the rest of us were soberminded don juan was the last of three musical things five hours at brighton in three actsof which one was over before we arrived none the worseand the beehive rather less flat and trumpery i have this moment received l from kind beautiful edward fanny has a similar gift i shall save what i can of it for your better leisure in this place my letter was from miss sharpenothing particular a letter from fanny cage this morning four oclockwe are just come back from doing mrs tickars miss hare and mr spence mr hall is here and while fanny is under his hands i will try to write a little more miss hare had some pretty caps and is to make me one like one of them only white satin instead of blue it will be white satin and lace and a little white flower perking out of the left ear like harriot byrons feather i have allowed her to go as far as l s my gown is to be trimmed everywhere with white ribbon plaited on somehow or other she says it will look well i am not sanguine they trim with white very much i learnt from mrs tickarss young lady to my high amusement that the stays now are not made to force the bosom up at all that was a very unbecoming unnatural fashion i was really glad to hear that they are not to be so much off the shoulders as they were going to mr spences was a sad business and cost us many tears unluckily we were obliged to go a second time before he could do more than just look we went first at halfpast twelve and afterwards at three papa with us each time and alas we are to go again tomorrow lizzy is not finished yet there have been no teeth taken out however nor will be i believe but he finds hers in a very bad state and seems to think particularly ill of their durableness they have been all cleaned hers filed and are to be filed again there is a very sad hole between two of her front teeth thursday morning halfpast sevenup and dressed and downstairs in order to finish my letter in time for the parcel at eight i have an appointment with madame b who wants to show me something downstairs at nine we are to set off for grafton house and get that over before breakfast edward is so kind as to walk there with us we are to be at mr spences again at from that time shall be driving about i suppose till four oclock at least we are if possible to call on mrs tilson mr hall was very punctual yesterday and curled me out at a great rate i thought it looked hideous and longed for a snug cap instead but my companions silenced me by their admiration i had only a bit of velvet round my head i did not catch cold however the weather is all in my favor i have had no pain in my face since i left you we had very good places in the box next the stagebox front and second row the three old ones behind of course i was particularly disappointed at seeing nothing of mr crabbe i felt sure of him when i saw that the boxes were fitted up with crimson velvet the new mr terry was lord ogleby and henry thinks he may do but there was no acting more than moderate and i was as much amused by the remembrances connected with midas as with any part of it the girls were very much delighted but still prefer don juan and i must say that i have seen nobody on the stage who has been a more interesting character than that compound of cruelty and lust it was not possible for me to get the worsteds yesterday i heard edward last night pressing henry to come to you and i think henry engaged to go there after his november collection nothing has been done as to s and s the books came to hand too late for him to have time for it before he went mr hastings never hinted at eliza in the smallest degree henry knew nothing of mr trimmers death i tell you these things that you may not have to ask them over again there is a new clerk sent down to alton a mr edmund williams a young man whom henry thinks most highly of and he turns out to be a son of the luckless williamses of grosvenor place i long to have you hear mr hs opinion of p and p his admiring my elizabeth so much is particularly welcome to me instead of saving my superfluous wealth for you to spend i am going to treat myself with spending it myself i hope at least that i shall find some poplin at layton and shears that will tempt me to buy it if i do it shall be sent to chawton as half will be for you for i depend upon your being so kind as to accept it being the main point it will be a great pleasure to me dont say a word i only wish you could choose too i shall send twenty yards now for bath poor f cage has suffered a good deal from her accident the noise of the white hart was terrible to her they will keep her quiet i dare say she is not so much delighted with the place as the rest of the party probably as she says herself from having been less well but she thinks she should like it better in the season the streets are very empty now and the shops not so gay as she expected they are at no henrietta street the corner of laura place and have no acquaintance at present but the bramstons lady bridges drinks at the cross bath her son at the hot and louisa is going to bathe dr parry seems to be half starving mr bridges for he is restricted to much such a diet as jamess bread water and meat and is never to eat so much of that as he wishes and he is to walk a great dealwalk till he drops i believegout or no gout it really is to that purpose i have not exaggerated charming weather for you and us and the travellers and everybody you will take your walk this afternoon and henrietta street

you all well and my mother no more in need of leeches whether this will be delivered to you by henry on saturday evening or by the postman on sunday morning i know not as he has lately recollected something of an engagement for saturday which perhaps may delay his visit he seems determined to come to you soon however i hope you will receive the gown tomorrow and may be able with tolerable honesty to say that you like the color it was bought at grafton house where by going very early we got immediate attendance and went on very comfortably i only forgot the one particular thing which i had always resolved to buy therea white silk handkerchiefand was therefore obliged to give six shillings for one at crook and besfords which reminds me to say that the worsteds ought also to be at chawton tomorrow and that i shall be very happy to hear they are approved i had not much time for deliberation we are now all four of us young ladies sitting round the circular table in the inner room writing our letters while the two brothers are having a comfortable coze in the room adjoining it is to be a quiet evening much to the satisfaction of four of the six my eyes are quite tired of dust and lamps the letter you forwarded from edward junr has been duly received he has been shooting most prosperously at home and dining at chilham castle and with mr scudamore my cap is come home and i like it very much fanny has one also hers is white sarsenet and lace of a different shape from mine more fit for morning carriage wear which is what it is intended for and is in shape exceedingly like our own satin and lace of last winter shaped round the face exactly like it with pipes and more fulness and a round crown inserted behind my cap has a peak in front large full bows of very narrow ribbon old twopenny are the thing one over the right temple perhaps and another at the left ear henry is not quite well his stomach is rather deranged you must keep him in rhubarb and give him plenty of port and water he caught his cold farther back than i told youbefore he got to matlock somewhere in his journey from the north but the ill effects of that i hope are nearly gone we returned from grafton house only just in time for breakfast and had scarcely finished breakfast when the carriage came to the door from eleven to halfpast three we were hard at it we did contrive to get to hans place for ten minutes mrs t was as affectionate and pleasing as ever after our return mr tilson walked up from the compting house and called upon us and these have been all our visitings i have rejoiced more than once that i bought my writingpaper in the country we have not had a quarter of an hour to spare i enclose the eighteenpence due to my mother the rose color was s and the other s per yard there was but two yards and a quarter of the dark slate in the shop but the man promised to match it and send it off correctly fanny bought her irish at newtons in leicester square and i took the opportunity of thinking about your irish and seeing one piece of the yard wide at s and it seemed to me very good good enough for your purpose it might at least be worth your while to go there if you have no other engagements fanny is very much pleased with the stockings she has bought of remmington silk at s cotton at s d she thinks them great bargains but i have not seen them yet as my hair was dressing when the man and the stockings came the poor girls and their teeth i have not mentioned them yet but we were a whole hour at spences and lizzys were filed and lamented over again and poor marianne had two taken out after all the two just beyond the eye teeth to make room for those in front when her doom was fixed fanny lizzy and i walked into the next room where we heard each of the two sharp and hasty screams the little girls teeth i can suppose in a critical state but i think he must be a lover of teeth and money and mischief to parade about fannys i would not have had him look at mine for a shilling a tooth and double it it was a disagreeable hour we then went to wedgwoods where my brother and fanny chose a dinnerset i believe the pattern is a small lozenge in purple between lines of narrow gold and it is to have the crest we must have been threequarters of an hour at grafton house edward sitting by all the time with wonderful patience there fanny bought the net for annas gown and a beautiful square veil for herself the edging there is very cheap i was tempted by some and i bought some very nice plaiting lace at s d fanny desires me to tell martha with her kind love that birchall assured her there was no second set of hooks lessons for beginners and that by my advice she has therefore chosen her a set by another composer i thought she would rather have something than not it costs six shillings with love to you all including triggs i remain yours very affectionately j austen henrietta st autumn of miss austen chawton by favor of xlvii godmersham park thursday sept my dearest cassandrathank you five hundred and forty times for the exquisite piece of workmanship which was brought into the room this morning while we were at breakfast with some very inferior works of art in the same way and which i read with high glee much delighted with everything it told whether good or bad it is so rich in striking intelligence that i hardly know what to reply to first i believe finery must have it i am extremely glad that you like the poplin i thought it would have my mothers approbation but was not so confident of yours remember that it is a present do not refuse me i am very rich mrs clement is very welcome to her little boy and to my congratulations into the bargain if ever you think of giving them i hope she will do well her sister in lucina mrs h gipps does too well we think mary p wrote on sunday that she had been three days on the sofa sackree does not approve it well there is some comfort in the mrs hulbarts not coming to you and i am happy to hear of the honey i was thinking of it the other day let me know when you begin the new tea and the new white wine my present elegances have not yet made me indifferent to such matters i am still a cat if i see a mouse i am glad you like our caps but fanny is out of conceit with hers already she finds that she has been buying a new cap without having a new pattern which is true enough she is rather out of luck to like neither her gown nor her cap but i do not much mind it because besides that i like them both myself i consider it as a thing of course at her time of lifeone of the sweet taxes of youth to choose in a hurry and make bad bargains i wrote to charles yesterday and fanny has had a letter from him today principally to make inquiries about the time of their visit here to which mine was an answer beforehand so he will probably write again soon to fix his week i am best pleased that cassy does not go to you now what have we been doing since i wrote last the mr ks came a little before dinner on monday and edward went to the church with the two seniors but there is no inscription yet drawn up they are very goodnatured you know and civil and all that but are not particularly superfine however they ate their dinner and drank their tea and went away leaving their lovely wadham in our arms and i wish you had seen fanny and me running backwards and forwards with his breeches from the little chintz to the white room before we went to bed in the greatest of frights lest he should come upon us before we had done it all there had been a mistake in the housemaids preparation and they were gone to bed he seems a very harmless sort of young man nothing to like or dislike in himgoes out shooting or hunting with the two others all the morning and plays at whist and makes queer faces in the evening footnote knatchbulls xlviii godmersham park monday oct my dearest aunt cassi have just asked aunt jane to let me write a little in her letter but she does not like it so i wont goodby you will have edwards letter tomorrow he tells me that he did not send you any news to interfere with mine but i do not think there is much for anybody to send at present we had our dinnerparty on wednesday with the addition of mrs and miss milles who were under a promise of dining here in their return from eastwell whenever they paid their visit of duty there and it happened to be paid on that day both mother and daughter are much as i have always found them i like the motherfirst because she reminds me of mrs birch and secondly because she is cheerful and grateful for what she is at the age of ninety and upwards the day was pleasant enough i sat by mr chisholme and we talked away at a great rate about nothing worth hearing it was a mistake as to the day of the sherers going being fixed they are ready but are waiting for mr pagets answer i inquired of mrs milles after jemima brydges and was quite grieved to hear that she was obliged to leave canterbury some months ago on account of her debts and is nobody knows where what an unprosperous family on saturday soon after breakfast mr j p left us for norton court i like him very much he gives me the idea of a very amiable young man only too diffident to be so agreeable as he might be he was out the chief of each morning with the other two shooting and getting wet through tomorrow we are to know whether he and a hundred young ladies will come here for the ball i do not much expect any the deedes cannot meet us they have engagements at home i will finish the deedes by saying that they are not likely to come here till quite late in my staythe very last week perhaps and i do not expect to see the moores at all they are not solicited till after edwards return from hampshire monday november is the day now fixed for our setting out poor basingstoke races there seem to have been two particularly wretched days on purpose for them and weyhill week does not begin much happier we were quite surprised by a letter from anna at tollard royal last saturday but perfectly approve her going and only regret they should all go so far to stay so few days we had thunder and lightning here on thursday morning between five and seven no very bad thunder but a great deal of lightning it has given the commencement of a season of wind and rain and perhaps for the next six weeks we shall not have two dry days together lizzy is very much obliged to you for your letter and will answer it soon but has so many things to do that it may be four or five days before she can this is quite her own message spoken in rather a desponding tone your letter gave pleasure to all of us we had all the reading of it of coursei three times as i undertook to the great relief of lizzy to read it to sackree and afterwards to louisa sackree does not at all approve of mary doe and her nutson the score of propriety rather than health she saw some signs of going after her in george and henry and thinks if you could give the girl a check by rather reproving her for taking anything seriously about nuts which they said to her it might be of use this of course is between our three discreet selves a scene of triennial bliss mrs breton called here on saturday i never saw her before she is a large ungenteel woman with selfsatisfied and wouldbe elegant manners we are certain of some visitors tomorrow edward bridges comes for two nights in his way from lenham to ramsgate and brings a friendname unknownbut supposed to be a mr harpur a neighboring clergyman and mr r mascall is to shoot with the young men which it is to be supposed will end in his staying dinner on thursday mr lushington mp for canterbury and manager of the lodge hounds dines here and stays the night he is chiefly young edwards acquaintance if i can i will get a frank from him and write to you all the sooner i suppose the ashford ball will furnish something as i wrote of my nephews with a little bitterness in my last i think it particularly incumbent on me to do them justice now and i have great pleasure in saying that they were both at the sacrament yesterday after having much praised or much blamed anybody one is generally sensible of something just the reverse soon afterwards now these two boys who are out with the foxhounds will come home and disgust me again by some habit of luxury or some proof of sporting mania unless i keep it off by this prediction they amuse themselves very comfortably in the evening by netting they are each about a rabbit net and sit as deedily to it side by side as any two uncle franks could do i am looking over selfcontrol again and my opinion is confirmed of its being an excellently meant elegantly written work without anything of nature or probability in it i declare i do not know whether lauras passage down the american river is not the most natural possible everyday thing she ever does tuesdaydear me what is to become of me such a long letter twoandforty lines in the second page like harriot byron i ask what am i to do with my gratitude i can do nothing but thank you and go on a few of your inquiries i think are replied to en avance the name of f cages drawingmaster is oneil we are exceedingly amused with your shalden news and your selfreproach on the subject of mrs stockwell made me laugh heartily i rather wondered that johncock the only person in the room could help laughing too i had not heard before of her having the measles mrs h and aletheas staying till friday was quite new to me a good plan however i could not have settled it better myself and am glad they found so much in the house to approve and i hope they will ask martha to visit them i admire the sagacity and taste of charlotte williams those large dark eyes always judge well i will compliment her by naming a heroine after her edward has had all the particulars of the building etc read to him twice over and seems very well satisfied a narrow door to the pantry is the only subject of solicitude it is certainly just the door which should not be narrow on account of the trays but if a case of necessity it must be borne i knew there was sugar in the tin but had no idea of there being enough to last through your company all the better you ought not to think this new loaf better than the other because that was the first of five which all came together something of fancy perhaps and something of imagination dear mrs digweed i cannot bear that she should not be foolishly happy after a ball i hope miss yates and her companions were all well the day after their arrival i am thoroughly rejoiced that miss benn has placed herself in lodgings though i hope they may not be long necessary no letter from charles yet southeys life of nelson i am tired of lives of nelson being that i never read any i will read this however if frank is mentioned in it here am i in kent with one brother in the same county and another brothers wife and see nothing of them which seems unnatural it will not last so forever i trust i should like to have mrs f a and her children here for a week but not a syllable of that nature is ever breathed i wish her last visit had not been so long a one i wonder whether mrs tilson has ever lainin mention it if it ever comes to your knowledge and we shall hear of it by the same post from henry mr rob mascall breakfasted here he eats a great deal of butter i dined upon goose yesterday which i hope will secure a good sale of my second edition have you any tomatas fanny and i regale on them every day disastrous letters from the plumptres and oxendens refusals everywherea blank partoutand it is not quite certain whether we go or not something may depend upon the disposition of uncle edward when he comes and upon what we hear at chilham castle this morning for we are going to pay visits we are going to each house at chilham and to mystole i shall like seeing the faggs i shall like it all except that we are to set out so early that i have not time to write as i would wish edwd bridgess friend is a mr hawker i find not harpur i would not have you sleep in such an error for the world my brother desires his best love and thanks for all your information he hopes the roots of the old beech have been dug away enough to allow a proper covering of mould and turf he is sorry for the necessity of building the new coin but hopes they will contrive that the doorway should be of the usual widthif it must be contracted on one side by widening it on the other the appearance need not signify and he desires me to say that your being at chawton when he is will be quite necessary you cannot think it more indispensable than he does he is very much obliged to you for your attention to everything have you any idea of returning with him to henrietta street and finishing your visit then tell me your sweet little innocent ideas everything of love and kindness proper and improper must now suffice yours very affectionately j austen miss

not coming or my not getting a frank i shall write very close from the first and even leave room for the seal in the proper place when i have followed up my last with this i shall feel somewhat less unworthy of you than the state of our correspondence now requires i left off in a great hurry to prepare for our morning visits of course was ready a good deal the first and need not have hurried so much fanny wore her new gown and cap i was surprised to find mystole so pretty the ladies were at home i was in luck and saw lady fagg and all her five daughters with an old mrs hamilton from canterbury and mrs and miss chapman from margate into the bargain i never saw so plain a familyfive sisters so very plain they are as plain as the foresters or the franfraddops or the seagraves or the rivers excluding sophy miss sally fagg has a pretty figure and that comprises all the good looks of the family it was stupidish fanny did her part very well but there was a lack of talk altogether and the three friends in the house only sat by and looked at us however miss chapmans name is laura and she had a double flounce to her gown you really must get some flounces are not some of your large stock of white morning gowns just in a happy state for a flouncetoo short nobody at home at either house in chilham edward bridges and his friend did not forget to arrive the friend is a mr wigram one

from ramsgate to brighton edw b persuaded him to take lenham on his way which gave him the convenience of mr ws gig and the comfort of not being alone there but probably thinking a few days of gm would be the cheapest and pleasantest way of entertaining his friend and himself offered a visit here and here they stay till tomorrow mr w is about five or sixandtwenty not illlooking and not agreeable he is certainly no addition a sort of cool gentlemanlike manner but very silent they say his name is henry a proof how unequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed i have seen many a john and thomas much more agreeable we have got rid of mr r mascall however i did not like him either he talks too much and is conceited besides having a vulgarly shaped mouth he slept here on tuesday so that yesterday fanny and i sat down to breakfast with six gentlemen to admire us we did not go to the ball it was left to her to decide and at last she determined against it she knew that it would be a sacrifice on the part of her father and brothers if they went and i hope it will prove that she has not sacrificed much it is not likely that there should have been anybody there whom she would care for i was very glad to be spared the trouble of dressing and going and being weary before it was half over so my gown and my cap are still unworn it will appear at last perhaps that i might have done without either i produced my brown bombazine yesterday and it was very much admired indeed and i like it better than ever you have given many particulars of the state of chawton house but still we want more edward wants to be expressly told that all the round tower etc is entirely down and the door from the best room stopped up he does not know enough of the appearance of things in that quarter he heard from bath yesterday lady b continues very well and dr parrys opinion is that while the water agrees with her she ought to remain there which throws their coming away at a greater uncertainty than we had supposed it will end perhaps in a fit of the gout which may prevent her coming away louisa thinks her mothers being so well may be quite as much owing to her being so much out of doors as to the water lady b is going to try the hot pump the cross bath being about to be painted louisa is particularly well herself and thinks the water has been of use to her she mentioned our inquiries etc to mr and mrs alex evelyn and had their best compliments and thanks to give in return dr parry does not expect mr e to last much longer only think of mrs holders being dead poor woman she has done the only thing in the world she could possibly do to make one cease to abuse her now if you please hooper must have it in his power to do more by his uncle lucky for the little girl an anne ekins can hardly be so unfit for the care of a child as a mrs holder a letter from wrotham yesterday offering an early visit here and mr and mrs moore and one child are to come on monday for ten days i hope charles and fanny may not fix the same time but if they come at all in october they must what is the use of hoping the two parties of children is the chief evil to be sure here we are the very thing has happened or rather worsea letter from charles this very morning which gives us reason to suppose they may come here today it depends upon the weather and the weather now is very fine no difficulties are made however and indeed there will be no want of room but i wish there were no wigrams and lushingtons in the way to fill up the table and make us such a motley set i cannot spare mr lushington either because of his frank but mr wigram does no good to anybody i cannot imagine how a man can have the impudence to come into a family party for three days where he is quite a stranger unless he knows himself to be agreeable on undoubted authority he and edw b are going to ride to eastwell and as the boys are hunting and my brother is gone to canty fanny and i have a quiet morning before us edward has driven off poor mrs salkeld it was thought a good opportunity of doing something towards clearing the house by her own desire mrs fanny is to be put in the room next the nursery her baby in a little bed by her and as cassy is to have the closet within and betsey williams little hole they will be all very snug together i shall be most happy to see dear charles and he will be as happy as he can with a cross child or some such care pressing on him at the time i should be very happy in the idea of seeing little cassy again too did not i fear she would disappoint me by some immediate disagreeableness the comfort of the billiardtable here is very great it draws all the gentlemen to it whenever they are within especially after dinner so that my brother fanny and i have the library to ourselves in delightful quiet there is no truth in the report of g hatton being to marry miss wemyss he desires it may be contradicted have you done anything about our present to miss benn i suppose she must have a bed at my mothers whenever she dines there how will they manage as to inviting her when you are gone and if they invite how will they continue to entertain her let me know as many of your parting arrangements as you can as to wine etc i wonder whether the inkbottle has been filled does butchers meat keep up at the same price and is not bread lower than s d marys blue gown my mother must be in agonies i have a great mind to have my blue gown dyed some time or other i proposed it once to you and you made some objection i forget what it is the fashion of flounces that gives it particular expediency mrs and miss wildman have just been here miss is very plain i wish lady b may be returned before we leave gm that fanny may spend the time of her fathers absence at goodnestone which is what she would prefer fridaythey came last night at about seven we had given them up but i still expected them to come dessert was nearly over a better time for arriving than an hour and a half earlier they were late because they did not set out earlier and did not allow time enough charles did not aim at more than reaching sittingbourne by three which could not have brought them here by dinnertime they had a very rough passage he would not have ventured if he had known how bad it would be however here they are safe and well just like their own nice selves fanny looking as neat and white this morning as possible and dear charles all affectionate placid quiet cheerful goodhumor they are both looking very well but poor little cassy is grown extremely thin and looks poorly i hope a weeks country air and exercise may do her good i am sorry to say it can be but a week the baby does not appear so large in proportion as she was nor quite so pretty but i have seen very little of her cassy was too tired and bewildered just at first to seem to know anybody we met them in the hallthe women and girl part of usbut before we reached the library she kissed me very affectionately and has since seemed to recollect me in the same way it was quite an evening of confusion as you may suppose at first we were all walking about from one part of the house to the other then came a fresh dinner in the breakfastroom for charles and his wife which fanny and i attended then we moved into the library were joined by the diningroom people were introduced and so forth and then we had tea and coffee which was not over till past ten billiards again drew all the odd ones away and edward charles the two fannies and i sat snugly talking i shall be glad to have our numbers a little reduced and by the time you receive this we shall be only a family though a large family party mr lushington goes tomorrow now i must speak of him and i like him very much i am sure he is clever and a man of taste he got a volume of milton last night and spoke of it with warmth he is quite an m p very smiling with an exceeding good address and readiness of language i am rather in love with him i dare say he is ambitious and insincere he puts me in mind of mr dundas he has a wide smiling mouth and very good teeth and something the same complexion and nose he is a much shorter man with marthas leave does martha never hear from mrs craven is mrs craven never at home we breakfasted in the diningroom today and are now all pretty well dispersed and quiet charles and george are gone out shooting together to winnigates and seaton wood i asked on purpose to tell henry mr lushington and edwd are gone some other way i wish charles may kill something but this high wind is against their sport lady williams is living at the rose at sittingbourne they called upon her yesterday she cannot live at sheerness and as soon as she gets to sittingbourne is quite well in return for all your matches i announce that her brother william is going to marry a miss austen of a wiltshire family who say they are related to us i talk to cassy about chawton she remembers much but does not volunteer on the subject poor little love i wish she were not so very palmery but it seems stronger than ever i never knew a wifes family features have such undue influence papa and mamma have not yet made up their mind as to parting with her or not the chief indeed the only difficulty with mamma is a very reasonable one the childs being very unwilling to leave them when it was mentioned to her she did not like the idea of it at all at the same time she has been suffering so much lately from seasickness that her mamma cannot bear to have her much on board this winter charles is less inclined to part with her i do not know how it will end or what is to determine it he desires his best love to you and has not written because he has not been able to decide they are both very sensible of your kindness on the occasion i have made charles furnish me with something to say about young kendall he is going on very well when he first joined the namur my brother did not find him forward enough to be what they call put in the office and therefore placed him under the schoolmaster but he is very much improved and goes into the office now every afternoon still attending school in the morning this cold weather comes very fortunately for edwards nerves with such a house full it suits him exactly he is all alive and cheerful poor james on the contrary must be running his toes into the fire i find that mary jane fowle was very near returning with her brother and paying them a visit on board i forget exactly what hindered her i believe the cheltenham scheme i am glad something did they are to go to cheltenham on monday sennight i dont vouch for their going you know it only comes from one of the family now i think i have written you a goodsized letter and may deserve whatever i can get in reply infinities of love i must distinguish that of fanny senior who particularly desires to be remembered to you all yours very affectionately j austen faversham oct miss austen chawton alton hants per s r lushington footnote mrs charles austen née fanny palmer l godmersham park oct my dear aunt cassandrai am very much obliged to you for your long letter and for the nice account of chawton we are all very glad to hear that the adams are gone and hope dame libscombe will be more happy now with her deaffy child as she calls it but i am afraid there is not much chance of her remaining long sole mistress of her house i am sorry you had not any better news to send us of our hare poor little thing i thought it would not live long in that pondy house i dont wonder that mary doe is very sorry it is dead because we promised her that if it was alive when we came back to chawton we would reward her for her trouble papa is much obliged to you for ordering the scrubby firs to be cut down i think he was rather frightened at first about the great oak fanny quite believed it for she exclaimed dear me what a pity how could they be so stupid i hope by this time they have put up some hurdles for the sheep or turned out the carthorses from the lawn pray tell grandmamma that we have begun getting seeds for her i hope we shall be able to get her a nice collection but i am afraid this wet weather is very much against them how glad i am to hear she has had such good success with her chickens but i wish there had been more bantams amongst them i am very sorry to hear of poor lizzies fate i must now tell you something about our poor people i believe you know old mary croucher she gets maderer and maderer every day aunt jane has been to see her but it was on one of her rational days poor will amos hopes your skewers are doing well he has left his house in the poor row and lives in a barn at builting we asked him why he went away and he said the fleas were so starved when he came back from chawton that they all flew upon him and eenermost eat him up how unlucky it is that the weather is so wet poor uncle charles has come home half drowned every day i dont think little fanny is quite so pretty as she was one reason is because she wears short petticoats i believe i hope cook is better she was very unwell the day we went away papa has given me halfadozen new pencils which are very good ones indeed i draw every other day i hope you go and whip lucy chalcraft every night miss clewes begs me to give her very best respects to you she is very much obliged to you for your kind inquiries after her pray give my duty to grandmamma and love to miss floyd i remain my dear aunt cassandra your very affectionate niece elizth knight thursdayi think lizzys letter will entertain you thank you for yours just received tomorrow shall be fine if possible you will be at guildford before our party set off they only go to key street as mr street the purser lives there and they have promised to dine and sleep with him cassys looks are much mended she agrees pretty well with her cousins but is not quite happy among them they are too many and too boisterous for her i have given her your message but she said nothing and did not look as if the idea of going to chawton again was a pleasant one they have edwards carriage to ospringe i think i have just done a good deedextracted charles from his wife and children upstairs and made him get ready to go out shooting and not keep mr moore waiting any longer mr and mrs sherer and joseph dined here yesterday very prettily edw and geo were absentgone for a night to eastling the two fannies went to canty in the morning and took lou and cass to try on new stays harriet and i had a comfortable walk together she desires her best love to you and kind remembrance to henry fannys best love also i fancy there is to be another party to canty tomorrowmr and mrs moore and me edward thanks henry for his letter we are most happy to hear he is so much better i depend upon you for letting me know what he wishes as to my staying with him or not you will be able to find out i dare say i had intended to beg you would bring one of my nightcaps with you in case of my staying but forgot it when i wrote on tuesday edward is much concerned about his pond he cannot now doubt the fact of its running out which he was resolved to do as long as possible i suppose my mother will like to have me write to her i shall try at least no i have never seen the death of mrs crabbe i have only just been making out from one of his prefaces that he probably was married it is almost ridiculous poor woman i will comfort him as well as i can but i do not undertake to be good to her children she had better not leave any edw and geo set off this day week for oxford our party will then be very small as the moores will be going about the same time to enliven us fanny proposes spending a few days soon afterwards at fredville it will really be a good opportunity as her father will have a companion we shall all three go to wrotham but edwd and i stay only a night perhaps love to mr tilson yours very affectionately j a miss austen henrietta st covent garden london li godmersham park wednesday nov my dearest cassandrai will keep this celebrated birthday by writing to you and as my pen seems inclined to write large i will put my lines very close together i had but just time to enjoy your letter yesterday before edward and i set off in the chair for canty and i allowed him to hear the chief of it as we went along we rejoice sincerely in henrys gaining ground as he does and hope there will be weather for him to get out every day this week as the likeliest way of making him equal to what he plans for the next if he is tolerably well the going into oxfordshire will make him better by making him happier can it be that i have not given you the minutiæ of edwards plans see here they are to go to wrotham on saturday the th spend sunday there and be in town on monday to dinner and if agreeable to henry spend one whole day with him which day is likely to be tuesday and so go down to chawton on wednesday but now i cannot be quite easy without staying a little while with henry unless he wishes it otherwise his illness and the dull time of year together make me feel that it would be horrible of me not to offer to remain with him and therefore unless you know of any objection i wish you would tell him with my best love that i shall be most happy to spend ten days or a fortnight in henrietta st if he will accept me i do not offer more than a fortnight because i shall then have been some time from home but it will be a great pleasure to be with him as it always is i have the less regret and scruple on your account because i shall see you for a day and a half and because you will have edward for at least a week my scheme is to take bookham in my way home for a few days and my hope that henry will be so good as to send me some part of the way thither i have a most kind repetition of mrs cookes two or three dozen invitations with the offer of meeting me anywhere in one of her airings fannys cold is much better by dosing and keeping her room on sunday she got rid of the worst of it but i am rather afraid of what this day may do for her she is gone to canty with miss clewes liz and marnne and it is but roughish weather for any one in a tender state miss clewes has been going to canty ever since her return and it is now just accomplishing edward and i had a delightful morning for our drive there i enjoyed it thoroughly but the day turned off before we were ready and we came home in some rain and the apprehension of a great deal it has not done us any harm however he went to inspect the gaol as a visiting magistrate and took me with him i was gratified and went through all the feelings which people must go through i think in visiting such a building we paid no other visits only walked about snugly together and shopped i bought a concert ticket and a sprig of flowers for my old age to vary the subject from gay to grave with inimitable address i shall now tell you something of the bath partyand still a bath party they are for a fit of the gout came on last week the accounts of lady b are as good as can be under such a circumstance dr p says it appears a good sort of gout and her spirits are better than usual but as to her coming away it is of course all uncertainty i have very little doubt of edwards going down to bath if they have not left it when he is in hampshire if he does he will go on from steventon and then return direct to london without coming back to chawton this detention does not suit his feelings it may be rather a good thing however that dr p should see lady b with the gout on her harriot was quite wishing for it the day seems to improve i wish my pen would too sweet mr ogle i dare say he sees all the panoramas for nothing has free admittance everywhere he is so delightful now you need not see anybody else i am glad to hear of our being likely to have a peep at charles and fanny at christmas but do not force poor cass to stay if she hates it you have done very right as to mrs f a your tidings of s and s give me pleasure i have never seen it advertised harriot in a letter to fanny today inquires whether they sell cloths for pelisses at bedford house and if they do will be very much obliged to you to desire them to send her down patterns with the width and prices they may go from charing cross almost any day in the week but if it is a readymoney house it will not do for the bru of feu the archbishop says she cannot pay for it immediately fanny and i suspect they do not deal in the article the sherers i believe are now really going to go joseph has had a bed here the last two nights and i do not know whether this is not the day of moving mrs sherer called yesterday to take leave the weather looks worse again we dine at chilham castle tomorrow and i expect to find some amusement but more from the concert the next day as i am sure of seeing several that i want to see we are to meet a party from goodnestone lady b miss hawley and lucy foote and i am to meet mrs harrison and we are to talk about ben and anna my dear mrs harrison i shall say i am afraid the young man has some of your family madness and though there often appears to be something of madness in anna too i think she inherits more of it from her mothers family than from ours that is what i shall say and i think she will find it difficult to answer me i took up your letter again to refresh me being somewhat tired and was struck with the prettiness of the hand it is really a very pretty hand now and thenso small and so neat i wish i could get as much into a sheet of paper another time i will take two days to make a letter in it is fatiguing to write a whole long one at once i hope to hear from you again on sunday and again on friday the day before we move on monday i suppose you will be going to streatham to see quiet mr hill and eat very bad bakers bread a fall in bread by the by i hope my mothers bill next week will show it i have had a very comfortable letter from her one of her foolscap sheets quite full of little home news anna was there the first of the two days an anna sent away and an anna fetched are different things this will be an excellent time for ben to pay his visit now that we the formidables are absent i did not mean to eat but mr johncock has brought in the tray so i must i am all alone edward is gone into his woods at this present time i have five tables eightandtwenty chairs and two fires all to myself miss clewes is to be invited to go to the concert with us there will be my brothers place and ticket for her as he cannot go he and the other connections of the cages are to meet at milgate that very day to consult about a proposed alteration of the maidstone road in which the cages are very much interested sir brook comes here in the morning and they are to be joined by mr deedes at ashford the loss of the concert will be no great evil to the squire we shall be a party of three ladies therefore and to meet three ladies what a convenient carriage henrys is to his friends in general who has it next i am glad williams going is voluntary and on no worse grounds an inclination for the country is a venial fault he has more of cowper than of johnson in himfonder of tame hares and blank verse than of the full tide of human existence at charing cross oh i have more of such sweet flattery from miss sharp she is an excellent kind friend i am read and admired in ireland too there is a mrs fletcher the wife of a judge an old lady and very good and very clever who is all curiosity to know about mewhat i am like and so forth i am not known to her by name however this comes through mrs carrick not through mrs gore you are quite out there i do not despair of having my picture in the exhibition at lastall white and red with my head on one side or perhaps i may marry young mr darblay i suppose in the mean time i shall owe dear henry a great deal of money for printing etc i hope mrs fletcher will indulge herself with s and s if i am to stay in h s and if you should be writing home soon i wish you would be so good as to give a hint of it for i am not likely to write there again these ten days having written yesterday fanny has set her heart upon its being a mr brett who is going to marry a miss dora best of this country i dare say henry has no objection pray where did the boys sleep the deedes come here on monday to stay till friday so that we shall end with a flourish the last canto they bring isabella and one of the grownups and will come in for a canty ball on thursday i shall be glad to see them mrs deedes and i must talk rationally together i suppose edward does not write to henry because of my writing so often god bless you i shall be so glad to see you again and i wish you many happy returns of this day poor lord howard how he does cry about it yours very truly j a miss austen henrietta street covent garden london footnote i cannot pass this paragraph over without remarking that it is hardly possible to imagine anything neater or prettier than janes own hand most of her letters are beautifully written and the ms of her lady susan remarkably sonote by lord brabourne lii godmersham park saturday nov my dearest cassandrahaving half an hour before breakfast very snug in my own room lovely morning excellent firefancy me i will give you some account of the last two days and yet what is there to be told i shall get foolishly minute unless i cut the matter short we met only the bretons at chilham castle besides a mr and mrs osborne and a miss lee staying in the house and were only fourteen altogether my brother and fanny thought it the pleasantest party they had ever known there and i was very well entertained by bits and scraps i had long wanted to see dr breton and his wife amuses me very much with her affected refinement and elegance miss lee i found very conversable she admires crabbe as she ought she is at an age of reason ten years older than myself at least she was at the famous ball at chilham castle so of course you remember her by the by as i must leave off being young i find many douceurs in being a sort of chaperon for i am put on the sofa near the fire and can drink as much wine as i like we had music in the evening fanny and miss wildman played and mr james wildman sat close by and listened or pretended to listen yesterday was a day of dissipation all through first came sir brook to dissipate us before breakfast then there was a call from mr sherer then a regular morning visit from lady honeywood in her way home from eastwell then sir brook and edward set off then we dined five in number at halfpast four then we had coffee and at six miss clewes fanny and i drove away we had a beautiful night for our frisks we were earlier than we need have been but after a time lady b and her two companions appearedwe had kept places for them and there we sat all six in a row under a side wall i between lucy foote and miss clewes lady b was much what i expected i could not determine whether she was rather handsome or very plain i liked her for being in a hurry to have the concert over and get away and for getting away at last with a great deal of decision and promptness not waiting to compliment and dawdle and fuss about seeing dear fanny who was half the evening in another part of the room with her friends the plumptres i am growing too minute so i will go to breakfast when the concert was over mrs harrison and i found each other out and had a very comfortable little complimentary friendly chat she is a sweet womanstill quite a sweet woman in herself and so like her sister i could almost have thought i was speaking to mrs lefroy she introduced me to her daughter whom i think pretty but most dutifully inferior to la mère beauté the faggs and the hammonds were therewm hammond the only young man of renown miss looked very handsome but i prefer her little smiling flirting sister julia i was just introduced at last to mary plumptre but i should hardly know her again she was delighted with me however good enthusiastic soul and lady b found me handsomer than she expected so you see i am not so very bad as you might think for it was twelve before we reached home we were all dogtired but pretty well today miss clewes says she has not caught cold and fannys does not seem worse i was so tired that i began to wonder how i should get through the ball next thursday but there will be so much more variety then in walking about and probably so much less heat that perhaps i may not feel it more my china crape is still kept for the ball enough of the concert i had a letter from mary yesterday they travelled down to cheltenham last monday very safely and are certainly to be there a month bath is still bath the h bridges must quit them early next week and louisa seems not quite to despair of their all moving together but to those who see at a distance there appears no chance of it dr parry does not want to keep lady b at bath when she can once move that is lucky you will see poor mr evelyns death since i wrote last my nd edit has stared me in the face mary tells me that eliza means to buy it i wish she may it can hardly depend upon any more fyfield estates i cannot help hoping that many will feel themselves obliged to buy it i shall not mind imagining it a disagreeable duty to them so as they do it mary heard before she left home that it was very much admired at cheltenham and that it was given to miss hamilton it is pleasant to have such a respectable writer named i cannot tire you i am sure on this subject or i would apologize what weather and what news we have enough to do to admire them both i hope you derive your full share of enjoyment from each i have extended my lights and increased my acquaintance a good deal within these two days lady honeywood you know i did not sit near enough to be a perfect judge but i thought her extremely pretty and her manners have all the recommendations of ease and goodhumor and unaffectedness and going about with four horses and nicely dressed herself she is altogether a perfect sort of woman oh and i saw mr gipps last nightthe useful mr gipps whose attentions came in as acceptably to us in handing us to the carriage for want of a better man as they did to emma plumptre i thought him rather a goodlooking little man i long for your letter tomorrow particularly that i may know my fate as to london my first wish is that henry should really choose what he likes best i shall certainly not be sorry if he does not want me morning church tomorrow i shall come back with impatient feelings the sherers are gone but the pagets are not come we shall therefore have mr s again mr paget acts like an unsteady man dr hant however gives him a very good character what is wrong is to be imputed to the lady i dare say the house likes female government i have a nice long black and red letter from charles but not communicating much that i did not know there is some chance of a good ball next week as far as females go lady bridges may perhaps be there with some knatchbulls mrs harrison perhaps with miss oxenden and the miss papillons and if mrs harrison then lady fagg will come the shades of evening are descending and i resume my interesting narrative sir brook and my brother came back about four and sir brook almost immediately set forward again to goodnestone we are to have edwd b tomorrow to pay us another sundays visitthe last for more reasons than one they all come home on the same day that we go the deedes do not come till tuesday sophia is to be the comer she is a disputable beauty that i want much to see lady eliz hatton and annamaria called here this morning yes they called but i do not think i can say anything more about them they came and they sat and they went sundaydearest henry what a turn he has for being ill and what a thing bile is this attack has probably been brought on in part by his previous confinement and anxiety but however it came i hope it is going fast and that you will be able to send a very good account of him on tuesday as i hear on wednesday of course i shall not expect to hear again on friday perhaps a letter to wrotham would not have an ill effect we are to be off on saturday before the post comes in as edward takes his own horses all the way he talks of nine oclock we shall bait at lenham excellent sweetness of you to send me such a nice long letter it made its appearance with one from my mother soon after i and my impatient feelings walked in how glad i am that i did what i did i was only afraid that you might think the offer superfluous but you have set my heart at ease tell henry that i will stay with him let it be ever so disagreeable to him oh dear me i have not time on paper for half that i want to say there have been two letters from oxfordone from george yesterday they got there very safelyedwd two hours behind the coach having lost his way in leaving london george writes cheerfully and quietly hopes to have uttersons rooms soon went to lecture on wednesday states some of his expenses and concludes with saying i am afraid i shall be poor i am glad he thinks about it so soon i believe there is no private tutor yet chosen but my brother is to hear from edwd on the subject shortly you and mrs h and catherine and alethea going about together in henrys carriage seeing sightsi am not used to the idea of it yet all that you are to see of streatham seen already your streatham and my bookham may go hang the prospect of being taken down to chawton by henry perfects the plan to me i was in hopes of your seeing some illuminations and you have seen them i thought you would come and you did come i am sorry he is not to come from the baltic sooner poor mary my brother has a letter from louisa today of an unwelcome nature they are to spend the winter at bath it was just decided on dr parry wished it not from thinking the water necessary to lady b but that he might be better able to judge how far his treatment of her which is totally different from anything she had been used to is right and i suppose he will not mind having a few more of her ladyships guineas his system is a lowering one he took twelve ounces of blood from her when the gout appeared and forbids wine etc hitherto the plan agrees with her she is very well satisfied to stay but it is a sore disappointment to louisa and fanny the h bridges leave them on tuesday and they mean to move into a smaller house you may guess how edward feels there can be no doubt of his going to bath now i should not wonder if he brought fanny cage back with him you shall hear from me once more some day or other yours very affectionately j a we do not like mr hampsons scheme miss austen henrietta street covent garden london liii henrietta st wednesday march we had altogether a very good journey and everything at cobham was comfortable i could not pay mr harrington that was the only alas of the business i shall therefore return his bill and my mothers l that you may try your luck we did not begin reading till bentley green henrys approbation is hitherto even equal to my wishes he says it is different from the other two but does not appear to think it at all inferior he has only married mrs r i am afraid he has gone through the most entertaining part he took to lady b and mrs n most kindly and gives great praise to the drawing of the characters he understands them all likes fanny and i think foresees how it will all be i finished the heroine last night and was very much amused by it i wonder james did not like it better it diverted me exceedingly we went to bed at ten i was very tired but slept to a miracle and am lovely today and at present henry seems to have no complaint we left cobham at halfpast eight stopped to bait and breakfast at kingston and were in this house considerably before two nice smiling mr barlowe met us at the door and in reply to inquiries after news said that peace was generally expected i have taken possession of my bedroom unpacked my bandbox sent miss ps two letters to the twopenny post been visited by md b and am now writing by myself at the new table in the front room it is snowing we had some snowstorms yesterday and a smart frost at night which gave us a hard road from cobham to kingston but as it was then getting dirty and heavy henry had a pair of leaders put on to the bottom of sloane st his own horses therefore cannot have had hard work i watched for veils as we drove through the streets and had the pleasure of seeing several upon vulgar heads and now how do you all doyou in particular after the worry of yesterday and the day before i hope martha had a pleasant visit again and that you and my mother could eat your beefpudding depend upon my thinking of the chimneysweeper as soon as i wake tomorrow places are secured at drury lane for saturday but so great is the rage for seeing kean that only a third and fourth row could be got as it is in a front box however i hope we shall do pretty wellshylock a good play for fannyshe cannot be much affected i think mrs perigord has just been here she tells me that we owe her master for the silkdyeing my poor old muslin has never been dyed yet it has been promised to be done several times what wicked people dyers are they begin with dipping their own souls in scarlet sin it is evening we have drank tea and i have torn through the third vol of the heroine i do not think it falls off it is a delightful burlesque particularly on the radcliffe style henry is going on with mansfield park he admires h crawford i mean properly as a clever pleasant man i tell you all the good i can as i know how much you will enjoy it we hear that mr kean is more admired than ever there are no good places to be got in drury lane for the next fortnight but henry means to secure some for saturday fortnight when you are reckoned upon give my love to little cass i hope she found my bed comfortable last night i have seen nobody in london yet with such a long chin as dr syntax nor anybody quite so large as gogmagolicus yours affly j austen footnotes mrs rushworth in mansfield park lady bertram and mrs norris liv henrietta st wednesday march well we went to the play again last night and as we were out a great part of the morning too shopping and seeing the indian jugglers i am very glad to be quiet now till dressingtime we are to dine at the tilsons and tomorrow at mr spencers we had not done breakfast yesterday when mr j plumptre appeared to say that he had secured a box henry asked him to dine here which i fancy he was very happy to do and so at five oclock we four sat down to table together while the master of the house was preparing for going out himself the farmers wife is a musical thing in three acts and as edward was steady in not staying for anything more we were at home before ten fanny and mr j p are delighted with miss s and her merit in singing is i dare say very great that she gave me no pleasure is no reflection upon her nor i hope upon myself being what nature made me on that article all that i am sensible of in miss s is a pleasing person and no skill in acting we had mathews liston and emery of course some amusement our friends were off before halfpast eight this morning and had the prospect of a heavy cold journey before them i think they both liked their visit very much i am sure fanny did henry sees decided attachment between her and his new acquaintance i have a cold too as well as my mother and martha let it be a generous emulation between us which can get rid of it first i wear my gauze gown today long sleeves and all i shall see how they succeed but as yet i have no reason to suppose long sleeves are allowable i have lowered the bosom especially at the corners and plaited black satin ribbon round the top such will be my costume of vineleaves and paste prepare for a play the very first evening i rather think covent garden to see young in richard i have answered for your little companions being conveyed to keppel st immediately i have never yet been able to get there myself but hope i shall soon what cruel weather this is and here is lord portsmouth married too to miss hanson henry has finished mansfield park and his approbation has not lessened he found the last half of the last volume extremely interesting i suppose my mother recollects that she gave me no money for paying brecknell and twining and my funds will not supply enough we are home in such good time that i can finish my letter tonight which will be better than getting up to do it tomorrow especially as on account of my cold which has been very heavy in my head this evening i rather think of lying in bed later than usual i would not but be well enough to go to hertford st on any account we met only genl chowne today who has not much to say for himself i was ready to laugh at the remembrance of frederick and such a different frederick as we chose to fancy him to the real christopher mrs tilson had long sleeves too and she assured me that they are worn in the evening by many i was glad to hear this she dines here i believe next tuesday on friday we are to be snug with only mr barlowe and an evening of business i am so pleased that the mead is brewed love to all i have written to mrs hill and care for nobody yours affectionately j austen miss austen chawton by favor of mr gray footnote his second wife he died in and was succeeded by his brother the father of the present earl lv chawton tuesday june my dearest cassandrafanny takes my mother to alton this morning which gives me an opportunity of sending you a few lines without any other trouble than that of writing them this is a delightful day in the country and i hope not much too hot for town well you had a good journey i trust and all that and not rain enough to spoil your bonnet it appeared so likely to be a wet evening that i went up to the gt house between three and four and dawdled away an hour very comfortably though edwd was not very brisk the air was clearer in the evening and he was better we all five walked together into the kitchen garden and along the gosport road and they drank tea with us you will be glad to hear that g turner has another situation something in the cow line near rumsey and he wishes to move immediately which is not likely to be inconvenient to anybody the new nurseryman at alton comes this morning to value the crops in the garden the only letter today is from mrs cooke to me they do not leave home till july and want me to come to them according to my promise and after considering everything i have resolved on going my companions promote it i will not go however till after edward is gone that he may feel he has a somebody to give memorandums to to the last i must give up all help from his carriage of course and at any rate it must be such an excess of expense that i have quite made up my mind to it and do not mean to care i have been thinking of triggs and the chair you may be sure but i know it will end in posting they will meet me at guildford in addition to their standing claims on me they admire mansfield park exceedingly mr cooke says it is the most sensible novel he ever read and the manner in which i treat the clergy delights them very much altogether i must go and i want you to join me there when your visit in henrietta st is over put this into your capacious head take care of yourself and do not be trampled to death in running after the emperor the report in alton yesterday was that they would certainly travel this road either to or from portsmouth i long to know what this bow of the princes will produce i saw mrs andrews yesterday mrs browning had seen her before she is very glad to send an elizabeth miss benn continues the same mr curtis however saw her yesterday and said her hand was going on as well as possible accept our best love yours very affectionately j austen miss austen henrietta street by favor of mr gray lvi thursday june dearest cassandrai received your pretty letter while the children were drinking tea with us as mr louch was so obliging as to walk over with it your good account of everybody made us very happy i heard yesterday from frank when he began his letter he hoped to be here on monday but before it was ended he had been told that the naval review would not take place till friday which would probably occasion him some delay as he cannot get some necessary business of his own attended to while portsmouth is in such a bustle i hope fanny has seen the emperor and then i may fairly wish them all away i go tomorrow and hope for some delays and adventures my mothers wood is brought in but by some mistake no bavins she must therefore buy some henry at whites oh what a henry i do not know what to wish as to miss b so i will hold my tongue and my wishes sackree and the children set off yesterday and have not been returned back upon us they were all very well the evening before we had handsome presents from the gt house yesterdaya ham and the four leeches sackree has left some shirts of her masters at the school which finished or unfinished she begs to have sent by henry and wm mr hinton is expected home soon which is a good thing for the shirts we have called upon miss dusantoy and miss papillon and been very pretty miss d has a great idea of being fanny priceshe and her youngest sister together who is named fanny miss benn has drank tea with the prowtings and i believe comes to us this evening she has still a swelling about the forefinger and a little discharge and does not seem to be on the point of a perfect cure but her spirits are good and she will be most happy i believe to accept any invitation the clements are gone to petersfield to look only think of the marquis of granby being dead i hope if it please heaven there should be another son they will have better sponsors and less parade i certainly do not wish that henry should think again of getting me to town i would rather return straight from bookham but if he really does propose it i cannot say no to what will be so kindly intended it could be but for a few days however as my mother would be quite disappointed by my exceeding the fortnight which i now talk of as the outsideat least we could not both remain longer away comfortably the middle of july is marthas time as far as she has any time she has left it to mrs craven to fix the day i wish she could get her money paid for i fear her going at all depends upon that instead of bath the deans dundases have taken a house at cliftonrichmond terraceand she is as glad of the change as even you and i should be or almost she will now be able to go on from berks and visit them without any fears from heat this post has brought me a letter from miss sharpe poor thing she has been suffering indeed but is now in a comparative state of comfort she is at sir w ps in yorkshire with the children and there is no appearance of her quitting them of course we lose the pleasure of seeing her here she writes highly of sir wm i do so want him to marry her there is a dow lady p presiding there to make it all right the man is the same but she does not mention what he is by profession or trade she does not think lady p was privy to his scheme on her but on being in his power yielded oh sir wm sir wm how i will love you if you will love miss sharpe mrs driver etc are off by collier but so near being too late that she had not time to call and leave the keys herself i have them however i suppose one is the key of the linenpress but i do not know what to guess the other the coach was stopped at the blacksmiths and they came running down with triggs and browning and trunks and birdcages quite amusing my mother desires her love and hopes to hear from you yours very affectionately j austen frank and mary are to have mary goodchild to help as under till they can get a cook she is delighted to go best love at streatham miss austen henrietta st by favor of mr gray lvii hans place tuesday morning august my dear cassandrai had a very good journey not crowded two of the three taken up at bentley being children the others of a reasonable size and they were all very quiet and civil we were late in london from being a great load and from changing coaches at farnham it was nearly four i believe when we reached sloane street henry himself met me and as soon as my trunk and basket could be routed out from all the other trunks and baskets in the world we were on our way to hans place in the luxury of a nice large cool dirty hackney coach there were four in the kitchen part of yalden and i was told fifteen at top among them percy benn we met in the same room at egham but poor percy was not in his usual spirits he would be more chatty i dare say in his way from woolwich we took up a young gibson at holybourn and in short everybody either did come up by yalden yesterday or wanted to come up it put me in mind of my own coach between edinburgh and stirling henry is very well and has given me an account of the canterbury races which seem to have been as pleasant as one could wish everything went well fanny had good partners mr was her second on thursday but he did not dance with her any more this will content you for the present i must just add however that there were no lady charlottes they were gone off to kirby and that mary oxenden instead of dying is going to marry wm hammond no james and edward yet our evening yesterday was perfectly quiet we only talked a little to mr tilson across the intermediate gardens she was gone out airing with miss burdett it is a delightful placemore than answers my expectation having got rid of my unreasonable ideas i find more space and comfort in the rooms than i had supposed and the garden is quite a love i am in the front attic which is the bedchamber to be preferred henry wants you to see it all and asked whether you would return with him from hampshire i encouraged him to think you would he breakfasts here early and then rides to henrietta st if it continues fine john is to drive me there by and by and we shall take an airing together and i do not mean to take any other exercise for i feel a little tired after my long jumble i live in his room downstairs it is particularly pleasant from opening upon the garden i go and refresh myself every now and then and then come back to solitary coolness there is one maidservant only a very creditable cleanlooking young woman richard remains for the present wednesday morningmy brother and edwd arrived last night they could not get places the day before their business is about teeth and wigs and they are going after breakfast to scarmans and tavistock st and they are to return to go with me afterwards in the barouche i hope to do some of my errands today i got the willow yesterday as henry was not quite ready when i reached hena st i saw mr hampson there for a moment he dines here tomorrow and proposed bringing his son so i must submit to seeing george hampson though i had hoped to go through life without it it was one of my vanities like your not reading patronage after leaving h st we drove to mrs latouches they are always at home and they are to dine here on friday we could do no more as it began to rain we dine at halfpast four today that our visitors may go to the play and henry and i are to spend the evening with the tilsons to meet miss burnett who leaves town tomorrow mrs t called on me yesterday is not this all that can have happened or been arranged not quite henry wants me to see more of his hanwell favorite and has written to invite her to spend a day or two here with me his scheme is to fetch her on saturday i am more and more convinced that he will marry again soon and like the idea of her better than of anybody else at hand now i have breakfasted and have the room to myself again it is likely to be a fine day how do you all do henry talks of being at chawton about the st of sept he has once mentioned a scheme which i should rather likecalling on the birches and the crutchleys in our way it may never come to anything but i must provide for the possibility by troubling you to send up my silk pelisse by collier on saturday i feel it would be necessary on such an occasion and be so good as to put up a clean dressinggown which will come from the wash on friday you need not direct it to be left anywhere it may take its chance we are to call for henry between three and four and i must finish this and carry it with me as he is not always there in the morning before the parcel is made up and before i set off i must return mrs tilsons visit i hear nothing of the hoblyns and abstain from all inquiry i hope mary jane and franks gardens go on well give my love to them allnunna hats love to george a great many people wanted to run up in the poach as well as me the wheat looked very well all the way and james says the same of his road the same good account of mrs cs health continues and her circumstances mend she gets farther and farther from poverty what a comfort goodby to you yours very truly and affectionately jane all well at steventon i hear nothing particular of ben except that edward is to get him some pencils miss austen chawton by favor of mr gray lviii my dear annai am very much obliged to you for sending your ms it has entertained me extremely indeed all of us i read it aloud to your grandmamma and aunt cass and we were all very much pleased the spirit does not droop at all sir thos lady helen and st julian are very well done and cecilia continues to be interesting in spite of her being so amiable it was very fit you should advance her age i like the beginning of devereux forester very much a great deal better than if he had been very good or very bad a few verbal corrections are all that i felt tempted to make the principal of them is a speech of st julian to lady helen which you see i have presumed to alter as lady h is cecilias superior it would not be correct to talk of her being introduced it is cecilia who must be introduced and i do not like a lover speaking in the rd person it is too much like the part of lord overtley and i think it not natural if you think differently however you need not mind me i am impatient for more and only wait for a safe conveyance to return this yours affectionately j a footnote miss anna austen at this time engaged to mr lefroy was writing a novel which she sent to her aunt for criticism lix august my dear annai am quite ashamed to find that i have never answered some question of yours in a former note i kept it on purpose to refer to it at a proper time and then forgot it i like the name which is the heroine very well and i dare say shall grow to like it very much in time but enthusiasm was something so very superior that my common title must appear to disadvantage i am not sensible of any blunders about dawlish the library was pitiful and wretched twelve years ago and not likely to have anybodys publications there is no such title as desborough either among dukes marquises earls viscounts or barons these were your inquiries i will now thank you for your envelope received this morning your aunt cass is as well pleased with st julian as ever and i am delighted with the idea of seeing progillian again wednesday we have now just finished the first of the three books i had the pleasure of receiving yesterday i read it aloud and we are all very much amused and like the work quite as well as ever i depend on getting through another book before dinner but there is really a good deal of respectable reading in your fortyeight pages i have no doubt six would make a very goodsized volume you must have been quite pleased to have accomplished so much i like lord portman and his brother very much i am only afraid that lord ps good nature will make most people like him better than he deserves the whole family are very good and lady anne who was your great dread you have succeeded particularly well with bell griffin is just what she should be my corrections have not been more important than before here and there we have thought the sense could be expressed in fewer words and i have scratched out sir thos from walking with the others to the stables etc the very day after breaking his arm for though i find your papa did walk out immediately after his arm was set i think it can be so little usual as to appear unnatural in a book lynn will not do lynn is towards forty miles from dawlish and would not be talked of there i have put starcross instead if you prefer easton that must be always safe i have also scratched out the introduction between lord portman and his brother and mr griffin a country surgeon dont tell mr c lyford would not be introduced to men of their rank and when mr p is first brought in he would not be introduced as the honorable that distinction is never mentioned at such times at least i believe not now we have finished the second book or rather the fifth i do think you had better omit lady helenas postscript to those that are acquainted with pride and prejudice it will seem an imitation and your aunt c and i both recommend your making a little alteration in the last scene between devereux f and lady clanmurray and her daughter we think they press him too much more than sensible or wellbred women would do lady c at least should have discretion enough to be sooner satisfied with his determination of not going with them i am very much pleased with egerton as yet i did not expect to like him but i do and susan is a very nice little animated creature but st julian is the delight of our lives he is quite interesting the whole of his breakoff with lady helena is very well done yes russell square is a very proper distance from berkeley square we are reading the last book they must be two days going from dawlish to bath they are nearly one hundred miles apart thursdaywe finished it last night after our return from drinking tea at the great house the last chapter does not please us quite so well we do not thoroughly like the play perhaps from having had too much of plays in that way lately vide mansfield park and we think you had better not leave england let the portmans go to ireland but as you know nothing of the manners there you had better not go with them you will be in danger of giving false representations stick to bath and the foresters there you will be quite at home your aunt c does not like desultory novels and is rather afraid yours will be too much so that there will be too frequently a change from one set of people to another and that circumstances will be introduced of apparent consequence which will lead to nothing it will not be so great an objection to me if it does i allow much more latitude than she does and think nature and spirit cover many sins of a wandering story and people in general do not care so much about it for your comfort i should like to have had more of devereux i do not feel enough acquainted with him you were afraid of meddling with him i dare say i like your sketch of lord clanmurray and your picture of the two young girls enjoyment is very good i have not noticed st julians serious conversation with cecilia but i like it exceedingly what he says about the madness of otherwise sensible women on the subject of their daughters coming out is worth its weight in gold i do not perceive that the language sinks pray go on lx chawton sept my dear annawe have been very much amused by your three books but i have a good many criticisms to make more than you will like we are not satisfied with mrs forester settling herself as tenant and near neighbor to such a man as sir thomas without having some other inducement to go there she ought to have some friend living thereabouts to tempt her a woman going with two girls just growing up into a neighborhood where she knows nobody but one man of not very good character is an awkwardness which so prudent a woman as mrs f would not be likely to fall into remember she is very prudent you must not let her act inconsistently give her a friend and let that friend be invited by sir thomas h to meet her and we shall have no objection to her dining at the priory as she does but otherwise a woman in her situation would hardly go there before she had been visited by other families i like the scene itself the miss leslie lady anne and the music very much leslie is a noble name sir thomas h you always do very well i have only taken the liberty of expunging one phrase of his which would not be allowablebless my heart it is too familiar and inelegant your grandmother is more disturbed at mrs foresters not returning the egertons visit sooner than by anything else they ought to have called at the parsonage before sunday you describe a sweet place but your descriptions are often more minute than will be liked you give too many particulars of right hand and left mrs forester is not careful enough of susans health susan ought not to be walking out so soon after heavy rains taking long walks in the dirt an anxious mother would not suffer it i like your susan very much she is a sweet creature her playfulness of fancy is very delightful i like her as she is now exceedingly but i am not quite so well satisfied with her behavior to george r at first she seems all over attachment and feeling and afterwards to have none at all she is so extremely confused at the ball and so well satisfied apparently with mr morgan she seems to have changed her character you are now collecting your people delightfully getting them exactly into such a spot as is the delight of my life three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on and i hope you will do a great deal more and make full use of them while they are so very favorably arranged you are but now coming to the heart and beauty of your story until the heroine grows up the fun must be imperfect but i expect a great deal of entertainment from the next three or four books and i hope you will not resent these remarks by sending me no more we like the egertons very well we see no blue pantaloons or cocks or hens there is nothing to enchant one certainly in mr l l but we make no objection to him and his inclination to like susan is pleasing the sister is a good contrast but the name of rachel is as much as i can bear they are not so much like the papillons as i expected your last chapter is very entertaining the conversation on genius etc mr st julian and susan both talk in character and very well in some former parts cecilia is perhaps a little too solemn and good but upon the whole her disposition is very well opposed to susans her want of imagination is very natural i wish you could make mrs forester talk more but she must be difficult to manage and make entertaining because there is so much good sense and propriety about her that nothing can be made very broad her economy and her ambition must not be staring the papers left by mrs fisher are very good of course one guesses something i hope when you have written a great deal more you will be equal to scratching out some of the past the scene with mrs mellish i should condemn it is prosy and nothing to the purpose and indeed the more you can find in your heart to curtail between dawlish and newton priors the better i think it will beone does not care for girls until they are grown up your aunt c quite understands the exquisiteness of that namenewton priors is really a nonpareil milton would have given his eyes to have thought of it is not the cottage taken from tollard royal thus far the letter was written on the th but before it was finished news arrived at chawton of the death of mrs charles austen she died in her confinement and the baby died also she left three little girlscassie harriet and fanny it was not until the th that jane resumed her letter as follows sundayi am very glad dear anna that i wrote as i did before this sad event occurred i have only to add that your grandmamma does not seem the worse now for the shock i shall be very happy to receive more of your work if more is ready and you write so fast that i have great hopes mr digweed will come back freighted with such a cargo as not all his hops or his sheep could equal the value of your grandmamma desires me to say that she will have finished your shoes tomorrow and thinks they will look very well and that she depends upon seeing you as you promise before you quit the country and hopes you will give her more than a day yours affectionately j austen footnote note by lord brabourne lxi chawton wednesday sept my dear annai hope you do not depend on having your book again immediately i kept it that your grandmamma may hear it for it has not been possible yet to have any public reading i have read it to your aunt cassandra however in our own room at night while we undressed and with a great deal of pleasure we like the first chapter extremely with only a little doubt whether lady helena is not almost too foolish the matrimonial dialogue is very good certainly i like susan as well as ever and begin now not to care at all about cecilia she may stay at easton court as long as she likes henry mellish will be i am afraid too much in the common novel stylea handsome amiable unexceptionable young man such as do not much abound in real life desperately in love and all in vain but i have no business to judge him so early jane egerton is a very natural comprehensible girl and the whole of her acquaintance with susan and susans letter to cecilia are very pleasing and quite in character but miss egerton does not entirely satisfy us she is too formal and solemn we think in her advice to her brother not to fall in love and it is hardly like a sensible womanit is putting it into his head we should like a few hints from her better we feel really obliged to you for introducing a lady kenrick it will remove the greatest fault in the work and i give you credit for considerable forbearance as an author in adopting so much of our opinion i expect high fun about mrs fisher and sir thomas you have been perfectly right in telling ben lefroy of your work and i am very glad to hear how much he likes it his encouragement and approbation must be quite beyond everything i do not at all wonder at his not expecting to like anybody so well as cecilia at first but i shall be surprised if he does not become a susanite in time devereux foresters being ruined by his vanity is extremely good but i wish you would not let him plunge into a vortex of dissipation i do not object to the thing but i cannot bear the expression it is such thorough novel slang and so old that i dare say adam met with it in the first novel he opened indeed i did very much like to know bens opinion i hope he will continue to be pleased with it and i think he must but i cannot flatter him with there being much incident we have no great right to wonder at his not valuing the name of progillian that is a source of delight which even he can hardly be quite competent to walter scott has no business to write novels especially good ones it is not fair he has fame and profit enough as a poet and should not be taking the bread out of the mouths of other people i do not like him and do not mean to like waverley if i can help it but fear i must i am quite determined however not to be pleased with mrs wests alicia de lacy should i ever meet with it which i hope i shall not i think i can be stout against anything written by mrs west i have made up my mind to like no novels really but miss edgeworths yours and my own what can you do with egerton to increase the interest for him i wish you could contrive something some family occurrence to bring out his good qualities more some distress among brothers and sisters to relieve by the sale of his curacy something to carry him mysteriously away and then be heard of at york or edinburgh in an old greatcoat i would not seriously recommend anything improbable but if you could invent something spirited for him it would have a good effect he might lend all his money to captain morris but then he would be a great fool if he did cannot the morrises quarrel and he reconcile them excuse the liberty i take in these suggestions your aunt franks nursemaid has just given her warning but whether she is worth your having or would take your place i know not she was mrs webbs maid before she went to the great house she leaves your aunt because she cannot agree with the other servants she is in love with the man and her head seems rather turned he returns her affection but she fancies every one else is wanting him and envying her her previous service must have fitted her for such a place as yours and she is very active and cleanly the webbs are really gone when i saw the wagons at the door and thought of all the trouble they must have in moving i began to reproach myself for not having liked them better but since the wagons have disappeared my conscience has been closed again and i am excessively glad they are gone i am very fond of sherlocks sermons and prefer them to almost any your affectionate aunt j austen if you wish me to speak to the maid let me know footnote a phrase always in the mouth of one of the chawton neighbors mrs h digweed lxii to miss frances austen chawton friday nov i feel quite as doubtful as you could be my dearest fanny as to when my letter may be finished for i can command very little quiet time at present but yet i must begin for i know you will be glad to hear as soon as possible and i really am impatient myself to be writing something on so very interesting a subject though i have no hope of writing anything to the purpose i shall do very little more i dare say than say over again what you have said before i was certainly a good deal surprised at first as i had no suspicion of any change in your feelings and i have no scruple in saying that you cannot be in love my dear fanny i am ready to laugh at the idea and yet it is no laughing matter to have had you so mistaken as to your own feelings and with all my heart i wish i had cautioned you on that point when first you spoke to me but though i did not think you then much in love i did consider you as being attached in a degree quite sufficiently for happiness as i had no doubt it would increase with opportunity and from the time of our being in london together i thought you really very much in love but you certainly are not at allthere is no concealing it what strange creatures we are it seems as if your being secure of him had made you indifferent there was a little disgust i suspect at the races and i do not wonder at it his expressions then would not do for one who had rather more acuteness penetration and taste than love which was your case and yet after all i am surprised that the change in your feelings should be so great he is just what he ever was only more evidently and uniformly devoted to you this is all the difference how shall we account for it my dearest fanny i am writing what will not be of the smallest use to you i am feeling differently every moment and shall not be able to suggest a single thing that can assist your mind i could lament in one sentence and laugh in the next but as to opinion or counsel i am sure that none will be extracted worth having from this letter i read yours through the very evening i received it getting away by myself i could not bear to leave off when i had once begun i was full of curiosity and concern luckily your at c dined at the other house therefore i had not to manoeuvre away from her and as to anybody else i do not care poor dear mr a oh dear fanny your mistake has been one that thousands of women fall into he was the first young man who attached himself to you that was the charm and most powerful it is among the multitudes however that make the same mistake with yourself there can be few indeed who have so little reason to regret it his character and his attachment leave you nothing to be ashamed of upon the whole what is to be done you have no inclination for any other person his situation in life family friends and above all his character his uncommonly amiable mind strict principles just notions good habits all that you know so well how to value all that is really of the first importanceeverything of this nature pleads his cause most strongly you have no doubt of his having superior abilities he has proved it at the university he is i dare say such a scholar as your agreeable idle brothers would ill bear a comparison with oh my dear fanny the more i write about him the warmer my feelings becomethe more strongly i feel the sterling worth of such a young man and the desirableness of your growing in love with him again i recommend this most thoroughly there are such beings in the world perhaps one in a thousand as the creature you and i should think perfection where grace and spirit are united to worth where the manners are equal to the heart and understanding but such a person may not come in your way or if he does he may not be the eldest son of a man of fortune the near relation of your particular friend and belonging to your own county think of all this fanny mr a has advantages which we do not often meet in one person his only fault indeed seems modesty if he were less modest he would be more agreeable speak louder and look impudenter and is not it a fine character of which modesty is the only defect i have no doubt he will get more lively and more like yourselves as he is more with you he will catch your ways if he belongs to you and as to there being any objection from his goodness from the danger of his becoming even evangelical i cannot admit that i am by no means convinced that we ought not all to be evangelicals and am at least persuaded that they who are so from reason and feeling must be happiest and safest do not be frightened from the connection by your brothers having most witwisdom is better than wit and in the long run will certainly have the laugh on her side and dont be frightened by the idea of his acting more strictly up to the precepts of the new testament than others and now my dear fanny having written so much on one side of the question i shall turn round and entreat you not to commit yourself farther and not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without affection and if his deficiencies of manner etc etc strike you more than all his good qualities if you continue to think strongly of them give him up at once things are now in such a state that you must resolve upon one or the othereither to allow him to go on as he has done or whenever you are together behave with a coldness which may convince him that he has been deceiving himself i have no doubt of his suffering a good deal for a timea great deal when he feels that he must give you up but it is no creed of mine as you must be well aware that such sort of disappointments kill anybody your sending the music was an admirable device it made everything easy and i do not know how i could have accounted for the parcel otherwise for though your dear papa most conscientiously hunted about till he found me alone in the diningparlor your aunt c had seen that he had a parcel to deliver as it was however i do not think anything was suspected we have heard nothing fresh from anna i trust she is very comfortable in her new home her letters have been very sensible and satisfactory with no parade of happiness which i liked them the better for i have often known young married women write in a way i did not like in that respect you will be glad to hear that the first edition of m p is all sold your uncle henry is rather wanting me to come to town to settle about a second edition but as i could not very conveniently leave home now i have written him my will and pleasure and unless he still urges it shall not go i am very greedy and want to make the most of it but as you are much above caring about money i shall not plague you with any particulars the pleasures of vanity are more within your comprehension and you will enter into mine at receiving the praise which every now and then comes to me through some channel or other saturdaymr palmer spent yesterday with us and is gone off with cassy this morning we have been expecting miss lloyd the last two days and feel sure of her today mr knight and mr edwd knight are to dine with us and on monday they are to dine with us again accompanied by their respectable host and hostess sundayyour papa had given me messages to you but they are unnecessary as he writes by this post to aunt louisa we had a pleasant party yesterday at least we found it so it is delightful to see him so cheerful and confident aunt cass and i dine at the great house today we shall be a snug halfdozen miss lloyd came as we expected yesterday and desires her love she is very happy to hear of your learning the harp i do not mean to send you what i owe miss hare because i think you would rather not be paid beforehand yours very affectionately jane austen miss knight goodnestone farm wingham kent footnote mansfield park lxiii chawton nov my dear annai met harriet benn yesterday she gave me her congratulations and desired they might be forwarded to you and there they are the chief news from this country is the death of old mrs dormer mrs clement walks about in a new black velvet pelisse lined with yellow and a white bobbin net veil and looks remarkably well in them i think i understand the country about hendon from your description it must be very pretty in summer should you know from the atmosphere that you were within a dozen miles of london make everybody at hendon admire mansfield park your affectionate aunt j a lxiv hans place nov my dear annai assure you we all came away very much pleased with our visit we talked of you for about a mile and a half with great satisfaction and i have been just sending a very good report of you to miss benn with a full account of your dress for susan and maria we were all at the play last night to see miss oneil in isabella i do not think she was quite equal to my expectations i fancy i want something more than can be i took two pockethandkerchiefs but had very little occasion for either she is an elegant creature however and hugs mr young delightfully i am going this morning to see the little girls in keppel street cassy was excessively interested about your marriage when she heard of it which was not until she was to drink your health on the weddingday she asked a thousand questions in her usual manner what he said to you and what you said to him if your uncle were at home he would send his best love but i will not impose any base fictitious remembrances on you mine i can honestly give and remain your affectionate aunt j austen lxv hans place wednesday my dear annai have been very far from finding your book an evil i assure you i read it immediately and with great pleasure i think you are going on very well the description of dr griffin and lady helenas unhappiness is very good and just what was likely to be i am curious to know what the end of them will be the name of newton priors is really invaluable i never met with anything superior to it it is delightful and one could live on the name of newton priors for a twelvemonth indeed i think you get on very fast i only wish other people of my acquaintance could compose as rapidly i am pleased with the dog scene and with the whole of george and susans love but am more particularly struck with your serious conversations they are very good throughout st julians history was quite a surprise to me you had not very long known it yourself i suspect but i have no objection to make to the circumstance and it is very well told his having been in love with the aunt gives cecilia an additional interest with him i like the ideaa very proper compliment to an aunt i rather imagine indeed that nieces are seldom chosen but out of compliment to some aunt or another i dare say ben was in love with me once and would never have thought of you if he had not supposed me dead of scarlet fever yes i was in a mistake as to the number of books i thought i had read three before the three at chawton but fewer than six will not do i want to see dear bell griffin again and had you not better give some hint of st julians early history in the beginning of the story we shall see nothing of streatham while we are in town as mrs hill is to lie in of a daughter mrs blackstone is to be with her mrs heathcote and miss bigg are just leaving the latter writes me word that miss blackford is married but i have never seen it in the papers and one may as well be single if the wedding is not to be in print your affectionate aunt j a lxvi hans place wednesday nov i am very much obliged to you my dear fanny for your letter and i hope you will write again soon that i may know you to be all safe and happy at home our visit to hendon will interest you i am sure but i need not enter into the particulars of it as your papa will be able to answer almost every question i certainly could describe her bedroom and her drawers and her closet better than he can but i do not feel that i can stop to do it i was rather sorry to hear that she is to have an instrument it seems throwing money away they will wish the twentyfour guineas in the shape of sheets and towels six months hence and as to her playing it never can be anything her purple pelisse rather surprised me i thought we had known all paraphernalia of that sort i do not mean to blame her it looked very well and i dare say she wanted it i suspect nothing worse than its being got in secret and not owned to anybody i received a very kind note from her yesterday to ask me to come again and stay a night with them i cannot do it but i was pleased to find that she had the power of doing so right a thing my going was to give them both pleasure very properly i just saw mr hayter at the play and think his face would please me on acquaintance i was sorry he did not dine here it seemed rather odd to me to be in the theatre with nobody to watch for i was quite composed myself at leisure for all the agitated isabella could raise now my dearest fanny i will begin a subject which comes in very naturally you frighten me out of my wits by your reference your affection gives me the highest pleasure but indeed you must not let anything depend on my opinion your own feelings and none but your own should determine such an important point so far however as answering your question i have no scruple i am perfectly convinced that your present feelings supposing that you were to marry now would be sufficient for his happiness but when i think how very very far it is from a now and take everything that may be into consideration i dare not say determine to accept him the risk is too great for you unless your own sentiments prompt it you will think me perverse perhaps in my last letter i was urging everything in his favor and now i am inclining the other way but i cannot help it i am at present more impressed with the possible evil that may arise to you from engaging yourself to himin word or mindthan with anything else when i consider how few young men you have yet seen much of how capable you are yes i do still think you very capable of being really in love and how full of temptation the next six or seven years of your life will probably be it is the very period of life for the strongest attachments to be formedi cannot wish you with your present very cool feelings to devote yourself in honor to him it is very true that you never may attach another man his equal altogether but if that other man has the power of attaching you more he will be in your eyes the most perfect i shall be glad if you can revive past feelings and from your unbiassed self resolve to go on as you have done but this i do not expect and without it i cannot wish you to be fettered i should not be afraid of your marrying him with all his worth you would soon love him enough for the happiness of both but i should dread the continuance of this sort of tacit engagement with such an uncertainty as there is of when it may be completed years may pass before he is independent you like him well enough to marry but not well enough to wait the unpleasantness of appearing fickle is certainly great but if you think you want punishment for past illusions there it is and nothing can be compared to the misery of being bound without lovebound to one and preferring another that is a punishment which you do not deserve i know you did not meet or rather will not meet today as he called here yesterday and i am glad of it it does not seem very likely at least that he should be in time for a dinner visit sixty miles off we did not see him only found his card when we came home at four your uncle h merely observed that he was a day after the fair we asked your brother on monday when mr hayter was talked of why he did not invite him too saying i know he is in town for i met him the other day in bond st edward answered that he did not know where he was to be found dont you know his chambers no i shall be most glad to hear from you again my dearest fanny but it must not be later than saturday as we shall be off on monday long before the letters are delivered and write something that may do to be read or told i am to take the miss moores back on saturday and when i return i shall hope to find your pleasant little flowing scrawl on the table it will be a relief to me after playing at maams for though i like miss h m as much as one can at my time of life after a days acquaintance it is uphill work to be talking to those whom one knows so little only one comes back with me tomorrow probably miss eliza and i rather dread it we shall not have two ideas in common she is young pretty chattering and thinking chiefly i presume of dress company and admiration mr sanford is to join us at dinner which will be a comfort and in the evening while your uncle and miss eliza play chess he shall tell me comical things and i will laugh at them which will be a pleasure to both i called in keppel street and saw them all including dear uncle charles who is to come and dine with us quietly today little harriot sat in my lap and seemed as gentle and affectionate as ever and as pretty except not being quite well fanny is a fine stout girl talking incessantly with an interesting degree of lisp and indistinctness and very likely may be the handsomest in time cassy did not show more pleasure in seeing me than her sisters but i expected no better she does not shine in the tender feelings she will never be a miss oneil more in the mrs siddons line thank you but it is not settled yet whether i do hazard a second edition we are to see egerton today when it will probably be determined people are more ready to borrow and praise than to buy which i cannot wonder at but though i like praise as well as anybody i like what edward calls pewter too i hope he continues careful of his eyes and finds the good effect of it i cannot suppose we differ in our ideas of the christian religion you have given an excellent description of it we only affix a different meaning to the word evangelical yours most affectionately j austen miss knight godmersham park faversham kent footnote sisters to mrs hall lxvii chawton friday sept my dear annawe told mr b lefroy that if the weather did not prevent us we should certainly come and see you tomorrow and bring cassy trusting to your being good enough to give her a dinner about one oclock that we might be able to be with you the earlier and stay the longer but on giving cassy her choice between the fair at alton or wyards it must be confessed that she has preferred the former which we trust will not greatly affront you if it does you may hope that some little anne hereafter may revenge the insult by a similar preference of an alton fair to her cousin cassy in the mean while we have determined to put off our visit to you until monday which we hope will be not less convenient i wish the weather may not resolve on another put off i must come to you before wednesday if it be possible for on that day i am going to london for a week or two with your uncle henry who is expected here on sunday if monday should appear too dirty for walking and mr lefroy would be so kind as to come and fetch me i should be much obliged to him cassy might be of the party and your aunt cassandra will take another opportunity yours very affectionately my dear anna j austen note by lord brabourne but before the week or two to which she had limited her visit in hans place was at an end her brother fell ill and on october he was in such danger that she wrote to steventon to summon her father to town the letter was two days on the road and reached him on sunday the th even then he did not start immediately in the evening he and his wife rode to chawton and it was not until the next day that he and cassandra arrived in hans place the malady from which henry austen was suffering was low fever and he was for some days at deaths door but he rallied soon after his brother and sisters arrived and recovered so quickly that the former was able to leave him at the end of the week the great anxiety and fatigue which jane underwent at this time was supposed by some of her family to have broken down her health she was in a very feeble and exhausted condition when the bank in which her brother henry was a partner broke and he not only lost all that he possessed but most of his relations suffered severely also jane was well enough to pay several visits with her sister in the summer of including one to steventonthe last she ever paid to that home of her childhood the last note which mrs lefroy had preserved is dated lxviii june my dear annacassy desires her best thanks for the book she was quite delighted to see it i do not know when i have seen her so much struck by anybodys kindness as on this occasion her sensibility seems to be opening to the perception of great actions these gloves having appeared on the pianoforte ever since you were here on friday we imagine they must be yours mrs digweed returned yesterday through all the afternoons rain and was of course wet through but in speaking of it she never once said it was beyond everything which i am sure it must have been your mamma means to ride to speen hill tomorrow to see the mrs hulberts who are both very indifferent by all accounts they really are breaking nownot so stout as the old jackass yours affectionately j a chawton sunday june uncle charless birthday lxix hans place friday nov my dearest cassandrai have the pleasure of sending you a much better account of my affairs which i know will be a great delight to you i wrote to mr murray yesterday myself and henry wrote at the same time to roworth before the notes were out of the house i received three sheets and an apology from r we sent the notes however and i had a most civil one in reply from mr m he is so very polite indeed that it is quite overcoming the printers have been waiting for paperthe blame is thrown upon the stationer but he gives his word that i shall have no further cause for dissatisfaction he has lent us miss williams and scott and says that any book of his will always be at my service in short i am soothed and complimented into tolerable comfort we had a visit yesterday from edwd knight and mr mascall joined him here and this morning has brought mr mascalls compliments and two pheasants we have some hope of edwards coming to dinner today he will if he can i believe he is looking extremely well tomorrow mr haden is to dine with us there is happiness we really grow so fond of mr haden that i do not know what to expect he and mr tilson and mr philips made up our circle of wits last night fanny played and he sat and listened and suggested improvements till richard came in to tell him that the doctor was waiting for him at captn blakes and then he was off with a speed that you can imagine he never does appear in the least above his profession or out of humor with it or i should think poor captn blake whoever he is in a very bad way i must have misunderstood henry when i told you that you were to hear from him today he read me what he wrote to edward part of it must have amused him i am sure one part alas cannot be very amusing to anybody i wonder that with such business to worry him he can be getting better but he certainly does gain strength and if you and edwd were to see him now i feel sure that you would think him improved since monday he was out yesterday it was a fine sunshiny day here in the country perhaps you might have clouds and fogs dare i say so i shall not deceive you if i do as to my estimation of the climate of london and he ventured first on the balcony and then as far as the greenhouse he caught no cold and therefore has done more today with great delight and selfpersuasion of improvement he has been to see mrs tilson and the malings by the by you may talk to mr t of his wifes being better i saw her yesterday and was sensible of her having gained ground in the last two days eveningwe have had no edward our circle is formedonly mr tilson and mr haden we are not so happy as we were a message came this afternoon from mrs latouche and miss east offering themselves to drink tea with us tomorrow and as it was accepted here is an end of our extreme felicity in our dinner guest i am heartily sorry they are coming it will be an evening spoilt to fanny and me another little disappointment mr h advises henrys not venturing with us in the carriage tomorrow if it were spring he says it would be a different thing one would rather this had not been he seems to think his going out today rather imprudent though acknowledging at the same time that he is better than he was in the morning fanny has had a letter full of commissions from goodnestone we shall be busy about them and her own matters i dare say from twelve to four nothing i trust will keep us from keppel street this day has brought a most friendly letter from mr fowle with a brace of pheasants i did not know before that henry had written to him a few days ago to ask for them we shall live upon pheasantsno bad life i send you five onepound notes for fear you should be distressed for little money lizzys work is charmingly done shall you put it to your chintz a sheet came in this moment st and rd vols are now at nd at i am sure you will like particulars we are not to have the trouble of returning the sheets to mr murray any longer the printers boys bring and carry i hope mary continues to get well fast and i send my love to little herbert you will tell me more of marthas plans of course when you write again remember me most kindly to everybody and miss benn besides yours very affectionately j austen i have been listening to dreadful insanity it is mr hadens firm belief that a person not musical is fit for every sort of wickedness i ventured to assert a little on the other side but wished the cause in abler hands miss austen chawton lxx hans place sunday nov my dearestthe parcel arrived safely and i am much obliged to you for your trouble it cost s d but as there is a certain saving of s d on the other side i am sure it is well worth doing i send four pair of silk stockings but i do not want them washed at present in the three neckhandkerchiefs i include the one sent down before these things perhaps edwd may be able to bring but even if he is not i am extremely pleased with his returning to you from steventon it is much better far preferable i did mention the p r in my note to mr murray it brought me a fine compliment in return whether it has done any other good i do not know but henry thought it worth trying the printers continue to supply me very well i am advanced in vol iii to my arraroot upon which peculiar style of spelling there is a modest query in the margin i will not forget annas arrowroot i hope you have told martha of my first resolution of letting nobody know that i might dedicate etc for fear of being obliged to do it and that she is thoroughly convinced of my being influenced now by nothing but the most mercenary motives i have paid nine shillings on her account to miss palmer there was no more owing well we were very busy all yesterday from halfpast eleven till four in the streets working almost entirely for other people driving from place to place after a parcel for sandling which we could never find and encountering the miseries of grafton house to get a purple frock for eleanor bridges we got to keppel st however which was all i cared for and though we could stay only a quarter of an hour fannys calling gave great pleasure and her sensibility still greater for she was very much affected at the sight of the children poor little f looked heavy we saw the whole party aunt harriet hopes cassy will not forget to make a pincushion for mrs kelly as she has spoken of its being promised her several times i hope we shall see aunt h and the dear little girls here on thursday so much for the morning then came the dinner and mr haden who brought good manners and clever conversation from seven to eight the harp at eight mrs l and miss e arrived and for the rest of the evening the drawingroom was thus arranged on the sofa side the two ladies henry and myself making the best of it on the opposite side fanny and mr haden in two chairs i believe at least they had two chairs talking together uninterruptedly fancy the scene and what is to be fancied next why that mr h dines here again tomorrow today we are to have mr barlow mr h is reading mansfield park for the first time and prefers it to p and p a hare and four rabbits from gm yesterday so that we are stocked for nearly a week poor farmer andrews i am very sorry for him and sincerely wish his recovery a better account of the sugar than i could have expected i should like to help you break some more i am glad you cannot wake early i am sure you must have been under great arrears of rest fanny and i have been to b chapel and walked back with maria cuthbert we have been very little plagued with visitors this last week i remember only miss herries the aunt but i am in terror for today a fine bright sunday plenty of mortar and nothing to do henry gets out in his garden every day but at present his inclination for doing more seems over nor has he now any plan for leaving london before dec when he thinks of going to oxford for a few days today indeed his feelings are for continuing where he is through the next two months one knows the uncertainty of all this but should it be so we must think the best and hope the best and do the best and my idea in that case is that when he goes to oxford i should go home and have nearly a week of you before you take my place this is only a silent project you know to be gladly given up if better things occur henry calls himself stronger every day and mr h keeps on approving his pulse which seems generally better than ever but still they will not let him be well perhaps when fanny is gone he will be allowed to recover faster i am not disappointed i never thought the little girl at wyards very pretty but she will have a fine complexion and curly hair and pass for a beauty we are glad the mammas cold has not been worse and send her our love and good wishes by every convenient opportunity sweet amiable frank why does he have a cold too like captain mirvan to mr duval i wish it well over with him fanny has heard all that i have said to you about herself and mr h thank you very much for the sight of dearest charless letter to yourself how pleasantly and how naturally he writes and how perfect a picture of his disposition and feelings his style conveys poor dear fellow not a present i have a great mind to send him all the twelve copies which were to have been dispersed among my near connections beginning with the p r and ending with countess morley adieu yours affectionately j austen give my love to cassy and mary jane caroline will be gone when this reaches you miss austen footnotes characters in miss burneys evelina prince regent lxxi hans place saturday dec my dear cassandrahenry came back yesterday and might have returned the day before if he had known as much in time i had the pleasure of hearing from mr t on wednesday night that mr seymour thought there was not the least occasion for his absenting himself any longer i had also the comfort of a few lines on wednesday morning from henry himself just after your letter was gone giving so good an account of his feelings as made me perfectly easy he met with the utmost care and attention at hanwell spent his two days there very quietly and pleasantly and being certainly in no respect the worse for going we may believe that he must be better as he is quite sure of being himself to make his return a complete gala mr haden was secured for dinner i need not say that our evening was agreeable but you seem to be under a mistake as to mr h you call him an apothecary he is no apothecary he has never been an apothecary there is not an apothecary in this neighborhoodthe only inconvenience of the situation perhapsbut so it is we have not a medical man within reach he is a haden nothing but a haden a sort of wonderful nondescript creature on two legs something between a man and an angel but without the least spice of an apothecary he is perhaps the only person not an apothecary hereabouts he has never sung to us he will not sing without a pianoforte accompaniment mr meyers gives his three lessons a week altering his days and his hours however just as he chooses never very punctual and never giving good measure i have not fannys fondness for masters and mr meyers does not give me any longing after them the truth is i think that they are all at least musicmasters made of too much consequence and allowed to take too many liberties with their scholars time we shall be delighted to see edward on monday only sorry that you must be losing him a turkey will be equally welcome with himself he must prepare for his own proper bedchamber here as henry moved down to the one below last week he found the other cold i am sorry my mother has been suffering and am afraid this exquisite weather is too good to agree with her i enjoy it all over me from top to toe from right to left longitudinally perpendicularly diagonally and i cannot but selfishly hope we are to have it last till christmasnice unwholesome unseasonable relaxing close muggy weather oh thank you very much for your long letter it did me a great deal of good henry accepts your offer of making his nine gallon of mead thankfully the mistake of the dogs rather vexed him for a moment but he has not thought of it since today he makes a third attempt at his strengthening plaister and as i am sure he will now be getting out a great deal it is to be wished that he may be able to keep it on he sets off this morning by the chelsea coach to sign bonds and visit henrietta st and i have no doubt will be going every day to henrietta st fanny and i were very snug by ourselves as soon as we were satisfied about our invalids being safe at hanwell by manoeuvring and good luck we foiled all the malings attempts upon us happily i caught a little cold on wednesday the morning we were in town which we made very useful and we saw nobody but our precious and mr tilson this evening the malings are allowed to drink tea with us we are in hopesthat is we wishmiss palmer and the little girls may come this morning you know of course that she could not come on thursday and she will not attempt to name any other day god bless you excuse the shortness of this but i must finish it now that i may save you d best love yours affectionately j a it strikes me that i have no business to give the p r a binding but we will take counsel upon the question i am glad you have put the flounce on your chintz i am sure it must look particularly well and it is what i had thought of miss austen chawton alton hants footnote probably a playful allusion to mr haden lxxii chawton feb my dearest fannyyou are inimitable irresistible you are the delight of my life such letters such entertaining letters as you have lately sent such a description of your queer little heart such a lovely display of what imagination does you are worth your weight in gold or even in the new silver coinage i cannot express to you what i have felt in reading your history of yourselfhow full of pity and concern and admiration and amusement i have been you are the paragon of all that is silly and sensible commonplace and eccentric sad and lively provoking and interesting who can keep pace with the fluctuations of your fancy the capprizios of your taste the contradictions of your feelings you are so odd and all the time so perfectly naturalso peculiar in yourself and yet so like everybody else it is very very gratifying to me to know you so intimately you can hardly think what a pleasure it is to me to have such thorough pictures of your heart oh what a loss it will be when you are married you are too agreeable in your single statetoo agreeable as a niece i shall hate you when your delicious play of mind is all settled down into conjugal and maternal affections mr b frightens me he will have you i see you at the altar i have some faith in mrs c cages observation and still more in lizzys and besides i know it must be so he must be wishing to attach you it would be too stupid and too shameful in him to be otherwise and all the family are seeking your acquaintance do not imagine that i have any real objection i have rather taken a fancy to him than not and i like the house for you i only do not like you should marry anybody and yet i do wish you to marry very much because i know you will never be happy till you are but the loss of a fanny knight will be never made up to me my affec niece f c b will be but a poor substitute i do not like your being nervous and so apt to cryit is a sign you are not quite well but i hope mr scudas you always write his name your mr scuds amuse me very muchwill do you good what a comfort that cassandra should be so recovered it was more than we had expected i can easily believe she was very patient and very good i always loved cassandra for her fine dark eyes and sweet temper i am almost entirely cured of my rheumatismjust a little pain in my knee now and then to make me remember what it was and keep on flannel aunt cassandra nursed me so beautifully i enjoy your visit to goodnestone it must be a great pleasure to you you have not seen fanny cage in comfort so long i hope she represents and remonstrates and reasons with you properly why should you be living in dread of his marrying somebody else yet how natural you did not choose to have him yourself why not allow him to take comfort where he can in your conscience you know that he could not bear a companion with a more animated character you cannot forget how you felt under the idea of its having been possible that he might have dined in hans place my dearest fanny i cannot bear you should be unhappy about him think of his principles think of his fathers objection of want of money etc etc but i am doing no good no all that i urge against him will rather make you take his part moresweet perverse fanny and now i will tell you that we like your henry to the utmost to the very top of the glass quite brimful he is a very pleasing young man i do not see how he could be mended he does really bid fair to be everything his father and sister could wish and william i love very much indeed and so we do all he is quite our own william in short we are very comfortable together that is we can answer for ourselves mrs deedes is as welcome as may to all our benevolence to her son we only lamented that we could not do more and that the l note we slipped into his hand at parting was necessarily the limit of our offering good mrs deedes scandal and gossip yes i dare say you are well stocked but i am very fond of mrs for reasons good thank you for mentioning her praise of emma etc i have contributed the marking to uncle hs shirts and now they are a complete memorial of the tender regard of many fridayi had no idea when i began this yesterday of sending it before your brother went back but i have written away my foolish thoughts at such a rate that i will not keep them many hours longer to stare me in the face much obliged for the quadrilles which i am grown to think pretty enough though of course they are very inferior to the cotillons of my own day ben and anna walked here last sunday to hear uncle henry and she looked so pretty it was quite a pleasure to see her so young and so blooming and so innocent as if she had never had a wicked thought in her life which yet one has some reason to suppose she must have had if we believe the doctrine of original sin i hope lizzy will have her play very kindly arranged for her henry is generally thought very goodlooking but not so handsome as edward i think i prefer his face wm is in excellent looks has a fine appetite and seems perfectly well you will have a great break up at godmersham in the spring you must feel their all going it is very right however poor miss c i shall pity her when she begins to understand herself your objection to the quadrilles delighted me exceedingly pretty well for a lady irrecoverably attached to one person sweet fanny believe no such thing of yourself spread no such malicious slander upon your understanding within the precincts of your imagination do not speak ill of your sense merely for the gratification of your fancy yours is sense which deserves more honorable treatment you are not in love with him you never have been really in love with him yours very affectionately j austen miss knight godmersham park faversham kent lxxiii chawton thursday march as to making any adequate return for such a letter as yours my dearest fanny it is absolutely impossible if i were to labor at it all the rest of my life and live to the age of methuselah i could never accomplish anything so long and so perfect but i cannot let william go without a few lines of acknowledgment and reply i have pretty well done with mr by your description he cannot be in love with you however he may try at it and i could not wish the match unless there were a great deal of love on his side i do not know what to do about jemima branfill what does her dancing away with so much spirit mean that she does not care for him or only wishes to appear not to care for him who can understand a young lady poor mrs c milles that she should die on the wrong day at last after being about it so long it was unlucky that the goodnestone party could not meet you and i hope her friendly obliging social spirit which delighted in drawing people together was not conscious of the division and disappointment she was occasioning i am sorry and surprised that you speak of her as having little to leave and must feel for miss milles though she is molly if a material loss of income is to attend her other loss single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony but i need not dwell on such arguments with you pretty dear to you i shall say as i have often said before do not be in a hurry the right man will come at last you will in the course of the next two or three years meet with somebody more generally unexceptionable than any one you have yet known who will love you as warmly as possible and who will so completely attract you that you will feel you never really loved before do none of the as ever come to balls now you have never mentioned them as being at any and what do you hear of the gripps or of fanny and her husband aunt cassandra walked to wyards yesterday with mrs digweed anna has had a bad cold and looks pale she has just weaned julia i have also heard lately from your aunt harriot and cannot understand their plans in parting with miss s whom she seems very much to value now that harriot and eleanor are both of an age for a governess to be so useful to especially as when caroline was sent to school some years miss bell was still retained though the others even then were nursery children they have some good reason i dare say though i cannot penetrate it and till i know what it is i shall invent a bad one and amuse myself with accounting for the difference of measures by supposing miss s to be a superior sort of woman who has never stooped to recommend herself to the master of the family by flattery as miss bell did i will answer your kind questions more than you expect miss catherine is put upon the shelf for the present and i do not know that she will ever come out but i have a something ready for publication which may perhaps appear about a twelvemonth hence it is shortabout the length of catherine this is for yourself alone neither mr salusbury nor mr wildman is to know of it i am got tolerably well again quite equal to walking about and enjoying the air and by sitting down and resting a good while between my walks i get exercise enough i have a scheme however for accomplishing more as the weather grows springlike i mean to take to riding the donkey it will be more independent and less troublesome than the use of the carriage and i shall be able to go about with aunt cassandra in her walks to alton and wyards i hope you will think wm looking well he was bilious the other day and at cass supplied him with a dose at his own request i am sure you would have approved it wm and i are the best of friends i love him very much everything is so natural about himhis affections his manners and his drollery he entertains and interests us extremely mat hammond and a m shaw are people whom i cannot care for in themselves but i enter into their situation and am glad they are so happy if i were the duchess of richmond i should be very miserable about my sons choice our fears increase for poor little harriot the latest account is that sir ev home is confirmed in his opinion of there being water on the brain i hope heaven in its mercy will take her soon her poor father will be quite worn out by his feelings for her he cannot spare cassy at present she is an occupation and a comfort to him lxxiv chawton sunday march i am very much obliged to you my dearest fanny for sending me mr ws conversation i had great amusement in reading it and i hope i am not affronted and do not think the worse of him for having a brain so very different from mine but my strongest sensation of all is astonishment at your being able to press him on the subject so perseveringly and i agree with your papa that it was not fair when he knows the truth he will be uncomfortable you are the oddest creature nervous enough in some respects but in others perfectly without nerves quite unrepulsable hardened and impudent do not oblige him to read any more have mercy on him tell him the truth and make him an apology he and i should not in the least agree of course in our ideas of novels and heroines pictures of perfection as you know make me sick and wicked but there is some very good sense in what he says and i particularly respect him for wishing to think well of all young ladies it shows an amiable and a delicate mind and he deserves better treatment than to be obliged to read any more of my works do not be surprised at finding uncle henry acquainted with my having another ready for publication i could not say no when he asked me but he knows nothing more of it you will not like it so you need not be impatient you may perhaps like the heroine as she is almost too good for me many thanks for your kind care for my health i certainly have not been well for many weeks and about a week ago i was very poorly i have had a good deal of fever at times and indifferent nights but i am considerably better now and am recovering my looks a little which have been bad enoughblack and white and every wrong color i must not depend upon being ever very blooming again sickness is a dangerous indulgence at my time of life thank you for everything you tell me i do not feel worthy of it by anything that i can say in return but i assure you my pleasure in your letters is quite as great as ever and i am interested and amused just as you could wish me if there is a miss marsden i perceive whom she will marry eveningi was languid and dull and very bad company when i wrote the above i am better now to my own feelings at least and wish i may be more agreeable we are going to have rain and after that very pleasant genial weather which will exactly do for me as my saddle will then be completed and air and exercise is what i want indeed i shall be very glad when the event at scarlets is over the expectation of it keeps us in a worry your grandmamma especially she sits brooding over evils which cannot be remedied and conduct impossible to be understood now the reports from keppel st are rather better little harriots headaches are abated and sir evd is satisfied with the effect of the mercury and does not despair of a cure the complaint i find is not considered incurable nowadays provided the patient be young enough not to have the head hardened the water in that case may be drawn off by mercury but though this is a new idea to us perhaps it may have been long familiar to you through your friend mr scud i hope his high renown is sustained by driving away williams cough tell wm that triggs is as beautiful and condescending as ever and was so good as to dine with us today and tell him that i often play at nines and think of him the papillons came back on friday night but i have not seen them yet as i do not venture to church i cannot hear however but that they are the same mr p and his sister they used to be she has engaged a new maidservant in mrs calkers room whom she means to make also housekeeper under herself old philmore was buried yesterday and i by way of saying something to triggs observed that it had been a very handsome funeral but his manner of reply made me suppose that it was not generally esteemed so i can only be sure of one part being very handsometriggs himself walking behind in his green coat mrs philmore attended as chief mourner in bombazine made very short and flounced with crape tuesdayi have had various plans as to this letter but at last i have determined that uncle henry shall forward it from london i want to see how canterbury looks in the direction when once uncle h has left us i shall wish him with you london has become a hateful place to him and he is always depressed by the idea of it i hope he will be in time for your sick i am sure he must do that part of his duty as excellently as all the rest he returned yesterday from steventon and was with us by breakfast bringing edward with him only that edwd stayed to breakfast at wyards we had a pleasant family day for the altons dined with us the last visit of the kind probably which she will be able to pay us for many a month i hope your own henry is in france and that you have heard from him the passage once over he will feel all happiness i took my first ride yesterday and liked it very much i went up mounters lane and round by where the new cottages are to be and found the exercise and everything very pleasant and i had the advantage of agreeable companions as at cass and edward walked by my side at cass is such an excellent nurse so assiduous and unwearied but you know all that already very affectionately yours j austen miss knight godmersham park canterbury lxxv chawton sunday sept my dearest cassandrai have borne the arrival of your letter today extremely well anybody might have thought it was giving me pleasure i am very glad you find so much to be satisfied with at cheltenham while the waters agree everything else is trifling a letter arrived for you from charles last thursday they are all safe and pretty well in keppel st the children decidedly better for broadstairs and he writes principally to ask when it will be convenient to us to receive miss p the little girls and himself they would be ready to set off in ten days from the time of his writing to pay their visits in hampshire and berkshire and he would prefer coming to chawton first i have answered him and said that we hoped it might suit them to wait till the last week in septr as we could not ask them sooner either on your account or the want of room i mentioned the rd as the probable day of your return when you have once left cheltenham i shall grudge every halfday wasted on the road if there were but a coach from hungerford to chawton i have desired him to let me hear again soon he does not include a maid in the list to be accommodated but if they bring one as i suppose they will we shall have no bed in the house even then for charles himselflet alone henry but what can we do we shall have the gt house quite at our command it is to be cleared of the papillons servants in a day or two they themselves have been hurried off into essex to take possessionnot of a large estate left them by an uncle but to scrape together all they can i suppose of the effects of a mrs rawstorn a rich old friend and cousin suddenly deceased to whom they are joint executors so there is a happy end of the kentish papillons coming here no morning service today wherefore i am writing between twelve and one oclock mr benn in the afternoon and likewise more rain again by the look and the sound of things you left us in doubt of mrs benns situation but she has bespoke her nurse the f as dined with us yesterday and had fine weather both for coming and going home which has hardly ever happened to them before she is still unprovided with a housemaid our day at alton was very pleasant venison quite right children well behaved and mr and mrs digweed taking kindly to our charades and other games i must also observe for his mothers satisfaction that edward at my suggestion devoted himself very properly to the entertainment of miss s gibson nothing was wanting except mr sweeney but he alas had been ordered away to london the day before we had a beautiful walk home by moonlight thank you my back has given me scarcely any pain for many days i have an idea that agitation does it as much harm as fatigue and that i was ill at the time of your going from the very circumstance of your going i am nursing myself up now into as beautiful a state as i can because i hear that dr white means to call on me before he leaves the country eveningfrank and mary and the children visited us this morning mr and mrs gibson are to come on the rd and there is too much reason to fear they will stay above a week little george could tell me where you were gone to as well as what you were to bring him when i asked him the other day sir tho miller is dead i treat you with a dead baronet in almost every letter so you have c craven among you as well as the duke of orleans and mr pocock but it mortifies me that you have not added one to the stock of common acquaintance do pray meet with somebody belonging to yourself i am quite weary of your knowing nobody mrs digweed parts with both hannah and old cook the former will not give up her lover who is a man of bad character the latter is guilty only of being unequal to anything miss terry was to have spent this week with her sister but as usual it is put off my amiable friend knows the value of her company i have not seen anna since the day you left us her father and brother visited her most days edward and ben called here on thursday edward was in his way to selborne we found him very agreeable he is come back from france thinking of the french as one could wishdisappointed in everything he did not go beyond paris i have a letter from mrs perigord she and her mother are in london again she speaks of france as a scene of general poverty and misery no money no trade nothing to be got but by the innkeepers and as to her own present prospects she is not much less melancholy than before i have also a letter from miss sharp quite one of her letters she has been again obliged to exert herself more than ever in a more distressing more harassed state and has met with another excellent old physician and his wife with every virtue under heaven who takes to her and cures her from pure love and benevolence dr and mrs storer are their mrs and miss palmerfor they are at bridlington i am happy to say however that the sum of the account is better than usual sir william is returned from bridlington they go to chevet and she is to have a young governess under her i enjoyed edwards company very much as i said before and yet i was not sorry when friday came it had been a busy week and i wanted a few days quiet and exemption from the thought and contrivancy which any sort of company gives i often wonder how you can find time for what you do in addition to the care of the house and how good mrs west could have written such books and collected so many hard words with all her family cares is still more a matter of astonishment composition seems to me impossible with a head full of joints of mutton and doses of rhubarb mondayhere is a sad morning i fear you may not have been able to get to the pump the two last days were very pleasant i enjoyed them the more for your sake but today it is really bad enough to make you all cross i hope mary will change her lodgings at the fortnights end i am sure if you looked about well you would find others in some odd corner to suit you better mrs potter charges for the name of the high st success to the pianoforte i trust it will drive you away we hear now that there is to be no honey this year bad news for us we must husband our present stock of mead and i am sorry to perceive that our twenty gallons is very nearly out i cannot comprehend how the fourteen gallons could last so long we do not much like mr coopers new sermons they are fuller of regeneration and conversion than ever with the addition of his zeal in the cause of the bible society marthas love to mary and caroline and she is extremely glad to find they like the pelisse the debarys are indeed odious we are to see my brother tomorrow but for only one night i had no idea that he would care for the races without edward remember me to all yours very affectionately j austen miss austen

the summer she should be able to walk back in april her father in a note to mrs lefroy says i was happy to have a good account of herself written by her own hand in a letter from your aunt jane but all who love and that is all who know her must be anxious on her account we all know how well grounded that anxiety was and how soon her relations had to lament over the loss of the dearest and brightest member of their family and now i come to the saddest letters of all those which tell us of the end of that bright life cut short just at the time when the world might have hoped that unabated intellectual vigor supplemented by the experience brought by maturer years would have produced works if possible even more fascinating than those with which she had already embellished the literature of her country but it was not to be the fiat had gone forththe ties which bound that sweet spirit to earth were to be severed and a blank left never to be filled in the family which her loved and loving presence had blessed and where she had been so well and fondly appreciated in the early spring of the unfavorable symptoms increased and the failure of her health was too visible to be neglected still no apprehensions of immediate danger were entertained and it is probable that when she left chawton for winchester in may she did not recognize the fact that she was bidding a last farewell to home happy for her if it was so for there are few things more melancholy than to look upon any beloved place or person with the knowledge that it is for the last time in all probability this grief was spared to jane for even after her arrival at winchester she spoke and wrote as if recovery was hopeful and i fancy that her relations were by no means aware that the end was so near note by lord brabourne cassandras letters tell the tale of the event in words that require no addition from me they are simple and affectingthe words of one who had been stricken by a great grief but whose religion stood her in good stead and enabled her to bear it with fortitude the firm and loving bond of union which had ever united the austen family naturally intensified their sorrow at the loss of one of their number and that the one of whom they had been so proud as well as so fond they laid her within the walls of the old cathedral which she had loved so much and went sorrowfully back to their homes with the feeling that nothing could replace to them the treasure they had lost and most heavily of all must the blow have fallen upon the only sister the correspondent the companion the other self of jane who had to return alone to the desolate home and to the mother to whose comforts the two had hitherto ministered together but who would henceforward have her alone on whom to rely letters from miss cassandra austen to her niece miss knight after the death of her sister jane july lxxvii winchester sunday my dearest fannydoubly dear to me now for her dear sake whom we have lost she did love you most sincerely and never shall i forget the proofs of love you gave her during her illness in writing those kind amusing letters at a time when i know your feelings would have dictated so different a style take the only reward i can give you in the assurance that your benevolent purpose was answered you did contribute to her enjoyment even your last letter afforded pleasure i merely cut the seal and gave it to her she opened it and read it herself afterwards she gave it to me to read and then talked to me a little and not uncheerfully of its contents but there was then a languor about her which prevented her taking the same interest in anything she had been used to do since tuesday evening when her complaint returned there was a visible change she slept more and much more comfortably indeed during the last eightandforty hours she was more asleep than awake her looks altered and she fell away but i perceived no material diminution of strength and though i was then hopeless of a recovery i had no suspicion how rapidly my loss was approaching i have lost a treasure such a sister such a friend as never can have been surpassed she was the sun of my life the gilder of every pleasure the soother of every sorrow i had not a thought concealed from her and it is as if i had lost a part of myself i loved her only too wellnot better than she deserved but i am conscious that my affection for her made me sometimes unjust to and negligent of others and i can acknowledge more than as a general principle the justice of the hand which has struck this blow you know me too well to be at all afraid that i should suffer materially from my feelings i am perfectly conscious of the extent of my irreparable loss but i am not at all overpowered and very little indisposednothing but what a short time with rest and change of air will remove i thank god that i was enabled to attend her to the last and amongst my many causes of selfreproach i have not to add any wilful neglect of her comfort she felt herself to be dying about half an hour before she became tranquil and apparently unconscious during that halfhour was her struggle poor soul she said she could not tell us what she suffered though she complained of little fixed pain when i asked her if there was anything she wanted her answer was she wanted nothing but death and some of her words were god grant me patience pray for me oh pray for me her voice was affected but as long as she spoke she was intelligible i hope i do not break your heart my dearest fanny by these particulars i mean to afford you gratification whilst i am relieving my own feelings i could not write so to anybody else indeed you are the only person i have written to at all excepting your grandmammait was to her not your uncle charles i wrote on friday immediately after dinner on thursday i went into the town to do an errand which your dear aunt was anxious about i returned about a quarter before six and found her recovering from faintness and oppression she got so well as to be able to give me a minute account of her seizure and when the clock struck six she was talking quietly to me i cannot say how soon afterwards she was seized again with the same faintness which was followed by the sufferings she could not describe but mr lyford had been sent for had applied something to give her ease and she was in a state of quiet insensibility by seven oclock at the latest from that time till halfpast four when she ceased to breathe she scarcely moved a limb so that we have every reason to think with gratitude to the almighty that her sufferings were over a slight motion of the head with every breath remained till almost the last i sat close to her with a pillow in my lap to assist in supporting her head which was almost off the bed for six hours fatigue made me then resign my place to mrs j a for two hours and a half when i took it again and in about an hour more she breathed her last i was able to close her eyes myself and it was a great gratification to me to render her those last services there was nothing convulsed which gave the idea of pain in her look on the contrary but for the continual motion of the head she gave one the idea of a beautiful statue and even now in her coffin there is such a sweet serene air over her countenance as is quite pleasant to contemplate this day my dearest fanny you have had the melancholy intelligence and i know you suffer severely but i likewise know that you will apply to the fountainhead for consolation and that our merciful god is never deaf to such prayers as you will offer the last sad ceremony is to take place on thursday morning her dear remains are to be deposited in the cathedral it is a satisfaction to me to think that they are to lie in a building she admired so much her precious soul i presume to hope reposes in a far superior mansion may mine one day be reunited to it your dear papa your uncle henry and frank and edwd austen instead of his father will attend i hope they will none of them suffer lastingly from their pious exertions the ceremony must be over before ten oclock as the cathedral service begins at that hour so that we shall be at home early in the day for there will be nothing to keep us here afterwards your uncle james came to us yesterday and is gone home today uncle h goes to chawton tomorrow morning he has given every necessary direction here and i think his company there will do good he returns to us again on tuesday evening i did not think to have written a long letter when i began but i have found the employment draw me on and i hope i shall have been giving you more pleasure than pain remember me kindly to mrs j bridges i am so glad she is with you now and give my best love to lizzie and all the others i am my dearest fanny most affectionately yours cass eliz austen i have said nothing about those at chawton because i am sure you hear from your papa lxxviii chawton tuesday july my dearest fannyi have just read your letter for the third time and thank you most sincerely for every kind expression to myself and still more warmly for your praises of her who i believe was better known to you than to any human being besides myself nothing of the sort could have been more gratifying to me than the manner in which you write of her and if the dear angel is conscious of what passes here and is not above all earthly feelings she may perhaps receive pleasure in being so mourned had she been the survivor i can fancy her speaking of you in almost the same terms there are certainly many points of strong resemblance in your characters in your intimate acquaintance with each other and your mutual strong affection you were counterparts thursday was not so dreadful a day to me as you imagined there was so much necessary to be done that there was no time for additional misery everything was conducted with the greatest tranquillity and but that i was determined i would see the last and therefore was upon the listen i should not have known when they left the house i watched the little mournful procession the length of the street and when it turned from my sight and i had lost her forever even then i was not overpowered nor so much agitated as i am now in writing of it never was human being more sincerely mourned by those who attended her remains than was this dear creature may the sorrow with which she is parted with on earth be a prognostic of the joy with which she is hailed in heaven i continue very tolerably wellmuch better than any one could have supposed possible because i certainly have had considerable fatigue of body as well as anguish of mind for months back but i really am well and i hope i am properly grateful to the almighty for having been so supported your grandmamma too is much better than when i came home i did not think your dear papa appeared unwell and i understand that he seemed much more comfortable after his return from winchester than he had done before i need not tell you that he was a great comfort to me indeed i can never say enough of the kindness i have received from him and from every other friend i get out of doors a good deal and am able to employ myself of course those employments suit me best which leave me most at leisure to think of her i have lost and i do think of her in every variety of circumstancein our happy hours of confidential intercourse in the cheerful family party which she so ornamented in her sickroom on her deathbed and as i hope an inhabitant of heaven oh if i may one day be reunited to her there i know the time must come when my mind will be less engrossed by her idea but i do not like to think of it if i think of her less as on earth god grant that i may never cease to reflect on her as inhabiting heaven and never cease my humble endeavors when it shall please god to join her there in looking at a few of the precious papers which are now my property i have found some memorandums amongst which she desires that one of her gold chains may be given to her goddaughter louisa and a lock of her hair be set for you you can need no assurance my dearest fanny that every request of your beloved aunt will be sacred with me be so good as to say whether you prefer a brooch or ring god bless you my dearest fanny believe me most affectionately yours cass elizth austen miss
